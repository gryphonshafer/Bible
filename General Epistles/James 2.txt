~ James 2 ~

= The Sin of Favoritism =

|1| My brothers, ^do^ not with ^partiality^ [literally ^respect^] to persons
{Jas 2:9, Deut 1:17, Lev 19:15, Job 34:19, Prov 24:23, Acts 10:34} ^keep^
[literally ^have^] the faith of our Lord of glory, {Acts 7:2, 1Cor 2:8} Jesus
Christ. [likely meaning "Do not show favoritism while keeping the Christian
faith."] |2| For if a gold-fingered man in fancy [or ^fine^ or ^bright^]
clothing comes into your synagogue, and also a poor one in shabby clothing, |3|
and you look on the ^one^ wearing the fancy clothing and say to him, "You sit
well here," and to the poor one you say, "You stand there or sit here under my
footstool," |4| did ^you^ not even make a ^discrimination^ [literally
^difference^] among yourselves {John 7:24} and become judges ^with^ evil
thoughts? [or ^motives^ or ^reasonings^] |5| Hear, my beloved brothers: Did not
God choose the poor of this world {1Cor 1:26- 1Cor 1:28} ^to be^ rich in faith
{Luke 12:21, Rev 2:9} and heirs of the kingdom {Matt 5:3, Matt 25:34} which He
promised to those ^who^ love Him. {Jas 1:12} |6| But you dishonored the poor
one. {1Cor 11:22} Do not the rich ones oppress you, and they drag you to court?
[literally ^judgment seats^] {Acts 8:3, Acts 16:19} |7| Do not they blaspheme
the good name ^to whom^ you ^were^ called? [literally ^the good name called upon
you^] {Acts 11:26, 1Pet 4:16}

|8| If you indeed fulfill the royal law [or ^the law of our King^] according to
Scripture: "You will love your neighbor as yourself," {Lev 19:18, Matt 5:43,
Matt 7:12} you do well. |9| But ^if^ you ^show partiality^, [literally ^respect
persons^] {Deut 1:17, Acts 10:34, Jas 2:1} you work sin, being reproved [or
^convicted^] by the law as transgressors. |10| For ^he^ who keeps all the law,
but stumbles in one, {Jas 3:2, 2Pet 1:10, Jude 1:24} he has become guilty ^of^
all. {Matt 5:19, Gal 3:10, Gal 5:3} |11| For he ^who^ said, "Do not ^commit^
[literally ^do^] adultery," also said, "Do not murder." {Exod 20:13-14, Deut
5:17-18} But if you do not ^commit^ adultry, but you murder, ^you^ have become a
transgressor of law. |12| So speak and so do, {Matt 16:27, Jas 1:25} as though
^you are^ [literally ^being^] about to be judged ^by^ the law of freedom. |13|
For the judgment will be unmerciful to the one not doing mercey; and mercey
exults [or ^triumphs^; literally ^boasts against^] over judgment. {Prov 21:13,
Matt 5:7, Matt 9:13, Matt 12:7, Matt 18:32-35, Luke 6:37-49}

= Faith and Works =

|14| What ^is^ the profit, my brothers, if anyone ^claims^ [literally ^says^] to
have faith, but he has not works? {Matt 7:26, Jas 1:22-25} Is the faith able to
save him? |15| If but a brother or a sister are naked {Luke 3:11} and may be
lacking of daily food, {Matt 25:35-36} |16| and ^if^ anyone of you says to them,
"Go in peace, be warmed and filled," but you ^do^ not give them the necessities
of the body, what ^is^ the profit? [or ^benefit^] {Luke 3:11, 1John 3:17-18}
|17| So indeed faith, if it has not works, is by itself dead. [or ^dead by its
own standards^] {Gal 5:6, Jas 2:20, Jas 2:26}

|18| But one will say, "You have faith, and I have works." [quotation may end
here or continue through end of this verse or next verse] Show me your faith
without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. {Rom 3:28, Rom
4:6, Heb 11:33, Jas 3:13, Gal 5:6} |19| You believe in one God? [literally ^that
God is one^] {Deut 6:4, Mark 12:29, 1Cor 8:4-6} You do well. The demons also
believe and tremble. {Matt 8:29, Mark 1:24, Mark 5:7, Luke 4:34, Acts 19:15}
|20| But are you willing to ^understand^, [literally ^know^] vain man, that
faith without works is dead? {Gal 5:6, Jas 2:17, Jas 2:26}

# |21| Was not Abraham our father justified by works,
# offering up Isaac his son on the altar?
# |22| You see that faith worked with his work,
# and by the works the faith was perfected,
# |23| and the Scripture was fulfilled,
# that says, "And Abraham believed God,
# and it was counted to him for righteousness,"
# and he was called friend of God.
# |24| You see then that a man is justified by works and not only by faith.
# |25| And likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works,
# entertaining the messengers, and sending ^them^ out by another way?
# |26| ^Just^ as the body without the spirit is dead,
# so also faith without works is dead.
