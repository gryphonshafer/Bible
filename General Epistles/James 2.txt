~ James 2 ~

= The Sin of Favoritism =

|1| My brothers, ^do^ not with ^partiality^ [literally ^respect^] to persons
{Jas 2:9, Deut 1:17, Lev 19:15, Job 34:19, Prov 24:23, Acts 10:34} ^keep^
[literally ^have^] the faith of our Lord of glory, {Acts 7:2, 1Cor 2:8} Jesus
Christ. [likely meaning "Do not show favoritism while keeping the Christian
faith."] |2| For if a gold-fingered man in fancy [or ^fine^ or ^bright^]
clothing comes into your synagogue, and also a poor one in shabby clothing, |3|
and you look on the ^one^ wearing the fancy clothing and say to him, "You sit
well here," and to the poor one you say, "You stand there or sit here under my
footstool," |4| did ^you^ not even make a ^discrimination^ [literally
^difference^] among yourselves {John 7:24} and become judges ^with^ evil
thoughts? [or ^motives^ or ^reasonings^] |5| Hear, my beloved brothers: Did not
God choose the poor of this world {1Cor 1:26- 1Cor 1:28} ^to be^ rich in faith
{Luke 12:21, Rev 2:9} and heirs of the kingdom {Matt 5:3, Matt 25:34} which He
promised to those ^who^ love Him. {Jas 1:12} |6| But you dishonored the poor
one. {1Cor 11:22} Do not the rich ones oppress you, and they drag you to court?
[literally ^judgment seats^] {Acts 8:3, Acts 16:19} |7| Do not they blaspheme
the good name ^to whom^ you ^were^ called? [literally ^the good name called upon
you^] {Acts 11:26, 1Pet 4:16}

|8| If you indeed fulfill the royal law [or ^the law of our King^] according to
Scripture: "You will love your neighbor as yourself," {Lev 19:18, Matt 5:43,
Matt 7:12} you do well. |9| But ^if^ you ^show partiality^, [literally ^respect
persons^] {Deut 1:17, Acts 10:34, Jas 2:1} you work sin, being reproved [or
^convicted^] by the law as transgressors. |10| For ^he^ who keeps all the law,
but stumbles in one, {Jas 3:2, 2Pet 1:10, Jude 1:24} he has become guilty ^of^
all. {Matt 5:19, Gal 3:10, Gal 5:3} |11| For he ^who^ said, "Do not ^commit^
[literally ^do^] adultery," also said, "Do not murder." {Exod 20:13-14, Deut
5:17-18} But if you do not ^commit^ adultry, but you murder, ^you^ have become a
transgressor of law. |12| So speak and so do, {Matt 16:27, Jas 1:25} as though
^you are^ [literally ^being^] about to be judged ^by^ the law of freedom. |13|
For the judgment will be unmerciful to the one not doing mercey; and mercey
exults [or ^triumphs^; literally ^boasts against^] over judgment. {Prov 21:13,
Matt 5:7, Matt 9:13, Matt 12:7, Matt 18:32-35, Luke 6:37-49}
