~ James 2 ~

= The Sin of Favoritism =

|1| My brothers, ^do^ not with ^partiality^ [literally ^respect^] to persons
{Jas 2:9, Deut 1:17, Lev 19:15, Job 34:19, Prov 24:23, Acts 10:34} ^keep^
[literally ^have^] the faith of our Lord of glory, {Acts 7:2, 1Cor 2:8} Jesus
Christ. [likely meaning "Do not show favoritism while keeping the Christian
faith."] |2| For if a gold-fingered man in fancy [or ^fine^ or ^bright^]
clothing comes into your synagogue, and also a poor one in shabby clothing, |3|
and you look on the ^one^ wearing the fancy clothing and say to him, "You sit
well here," and to the poor one you say, "You stand there or sit here under my
footstool," |4| did ^you^ not even make a ^discrimination^ [literally
^difference^] among yourselves {John 7:24} and become judges ^with^ evil
thoughts? [or ^motives^ or ^reasonings^] |5| Hear, my beloved brothers: Did not
God choose the poor of this world {1Cor 1:26- 1Cor 1:28} ^to be^ rich in faith
{Luke 12:21, Rev 2:9} and heirs of the kingdom {Matt 5:3, Matt 25:34} which He
promised to those ^who^ love Him. {Jas 1:12} |6| But you dishonored the poor
one. {1Cor 11:22} Do not the rich ones oppress you, and they drag you to court?
[literally ^judgment seats^] {Acts 8:3, Acts 16:19} |7| Do not they blaspheme
the good name ^to whom^ you ^were^ called? [literally ^the good name called upon
you^] {Acts 11:26, 1Pet 4:16}

# |8| If indeed law you fulfill a royal according to the Scripture:
# You shall love the neighbor of you as yourself, well you do;
# |9| if but you respect persons, sin you work, being reproved by the law as transgressors,
# |10| ^he^ who for all the law keeps, stumbles but in one, he has become all guilty
# |11| he for saying, do not do adultery, said also, do not murder,
# if but not you do adultry, murder but you have become a transgressor of law,
# |12| so speak and so do, as though a law of freedom being about to be judged.
# |13| The for judgment will be unmerciful to the one not doing mercey; and exults over mercey judgment.
