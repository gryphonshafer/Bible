~ James 1 ~

= Greeting =

|1| James, [or ^Jacob^] {Acts 12:17; Acts 15:13} a slave of God {Rom 1:1, Titus
1:1} and of ^the^ Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes {Luke 22:30; Acts
26:7} dispersed: [literally ^in the dispersion^] {Deut 32:26, John 7:35, 1Pet
1:1}

Greetings. {Acts 15:23}

= Temptations and Patience =

|2| Count ^it^ all joy, my brothers, [Greek word ^adelphoi^ means ^brothers and
sisters^ and refers to Christian believers] when you fall into various
temptations [or ^trials^], {Jas 1:12, James 5:11; Matt 5:12, Heb 10:34, Heb
12:11; 1Pet 1:6} |3| knowing that the proving of your faith {Heb 6:12; 1Pe 1:7}
^builds^ [or ^works^] patience. {Luke 21:19; Heb 10:36} |4| And let patience
^build^ [or ^work^] to ^completion^, [or ^maturity^ or ^to perfection^;
literally ^let it have perfect^] that you may be perfect and ^complete^, [or
^entire^ or ^whole^] {Matt 5:48, Col 4:12} having lacked in nothing.

|5| But if any of you lacks wisdom, {James 3:17} let him ask from God, {1Kgs
3:9, 1Kgs 3:10, Prov 2:3-Prov 2:6} ^who^ gives to all ^generously^ [literally
^freely^] and without reproach, [or ^without finding fault^] and it will be
given to him. {Ps 51:6, Dan 1:17, Dan 2:21, Matt 7:7} |6| But let him ask in
faith, doubting nothing. {Matt 21:21, Mark 11:23-24; Acts 10:20} ^He who^ doubts
^is^ like a wave of ^the^ sea, being driven by wind and tossed. {Matt 14:28-31,
Eph 4:14} |7| For let not that man suppose he will receive anything from the
Lord. |8| ^Such^ a man ^is double-minded^, [literally ^two-souled^] {Ps 119:113,
Jas 4:8} undependable in all his ways. {2Pet 2:14, 2Pet 3:16}

|9| But let the humble brother [or church member] boast in his height; |10| and
^let^ the rich one ^boast^ in his humiliation, {Matt 23:12; Luke 14:11} because
he will pass away like a grass flower, [or ^wild flower^] {Job 14:2,
Ps 103:15-16, Isa 40:6-7, 1Cor 7:31, 1Pet 1:24} |11| for the sun rose with a
hot wind [or ^burning heat^] and dried the grass, and its flower fell off,
{Ps 102:4, Ps 102:11; Isa 40:6-Isa 40:8} and the beauty of its appearance
perished; so also the rich one in his ^ways^ [or ^goings^] will fade away.

# 12-15

# |12| Blessed ^the^ man who endures temptation,
# because approved having become he will receive the crown of life,
# which promised the Lord to those loving Him.
# |13| No one being tempted Let say, "From God I am tempted,"
# for God not tempted is by evils, tempts and He no one.
# |14| Each one but is tempted by the own lusts being drawn out and being seduced;
# |15| then lust having conceived pruces sin; and sin being fully formed brings forth death.

# 16-18

# |16| Do not go astray, brothers of me beloved.
# |17| Every giving good and every gift perfect from above is,
# coming down from the Father of lights,
# with whom not there is variation or of turning shadow.
# |18| Having purposed He brought forth us by a word of truth,
# for to be us firstfruit a certain of the of Him creatures.
