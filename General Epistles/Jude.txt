~ Jude 1 ~

|1| Jude, [or ^Judas^] {Matt 13:55, Mark 6:3, John 14:22, Acts 1:13} a slave
[or ^servant^] {Titus 1:1} of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, [or ^Jacob^]
to those having been set apart [or ^loved^ or ^sanctified^] in God ^the^
Father, {Rom 1:6, Rom 1:7} and having been kept [or ^called^] by [or ^for^ or
^in^] Jesus Christ: {John 17:12, 1 Pet 1:5}

|2| Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. {Gal 6:16, 1Tim 1:2, 1Pet 1:2,
2Pet 1:2}

= The Sin and Punishment of the Ungodly =

|3| Beloved, {Heb 6:9, Jude 1:17,20} making all diligence to write to you about
the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting ^you^ to
earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints. [or ^holy ones^]
{Jude 1:20, Acts 6:7} |4| For certain men crept in, {Gal 2:4, 2Tim 3:6} those
^who long ago were^ [literally ^of old having been previously^] written into
this judgment, [or ^marked out for condemnation^] ungodly ones ^who^ pervert
the grace of our God for unbridled lust and deny our only Master God and our
Lord Jesus Christ. {Titus 1:16; 1Pet 2:8; 2Pet 2:1,7,21; 1John 2:22; 2Tim 2:12}

|5| But I intend ^to remind^ you ^that^ you once knew these things,
{1John 2:20; 2Pet 1:12, 2Pet 1:13, 2Pet 3:1, 2Pet 3:2} that the Lord
[some early manuscripts use the word ^Jesus^ or ^Joshua^ or ^God^] saved
people out of ^the^ land of Egypt, ^and thereafter^ [or ^in the second place^]
He destroyed those ^who did^ not believe. {Ex 12:51; Deut 1:32; Deut 2:15;
Ps 106:26; 1Cor 10:5, Heb 3:16, Heb 3:17} |6| Angels and those who did not
keep their first place, but deserted their dwelling place, He has kept in
eternal chains under blackness for a great day of judgement. {2Pet 2:4,
2Pet 2:9} |7| Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, in a similar
manner to these, committed fornication and went away after other [or ^strange^
or ^different^] flesh, {Gen 19:24-38, Deut 29:23, 2Pet 2:2} [full phrase is
^and went away after other flesh laid before times^] an example of undergoing
^the^ everlasting fire ^of^ vengeance. {Matt 25:41, 2Thes 1:8-12, 2Pet 2:6,
2Pet 3:7}
