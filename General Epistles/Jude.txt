~ Jude 1 ~

|1| Jude, [or ^Judas^] {Matt 13:55, Mark 6:3, John 14:22, Acts 1:13} a slave
[or ^servant^] {Titus 1:1} of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, [or ^Jacob^]
to those having been set apart [or ^loved^ or ^sanctified^] in God ^the^
Father, {Rom 1:6, Rom 1:7} and having been kept [or ^called^] by [or ^for^ or
^in^] Jesus Christ: {John 17:12, 1 Pet 1:5}

|2| Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. {Gal 6:16, 1Tim 1:2, 1Pet 1:2,
2Pet 1:2}

= The Sin and Punishment of the Ungodly =

|3| Beloved, {Heb 6:9, Jude 1:17,20} making all diligence to write to you about
the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting ^you^ to
earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints. [or ^holy ones^]
{Jude 1:20, Acts 6:7} |4| For certain men crept in, {Gal 2:4, 2Tim 3:6} those
^who long ago were^ [literally ^of old having been previously^] written into
this judgment, [or ^marked out for condemnation^] ungodly ones ^who^ pervert
the grace of our God for unbridled lust and deny our only Master God and our
Lord Jesus Christ. {Titus 1:16; 1Pet 2:8; 2Pet 2:1,7,21; 1John 2:22; 2Tim 2:12}

|5| But I intend ^to remind^ you ^that^ you once knew these things,
{1John 2:20; 2Pet 1:12, 2Pet 1:13, 2Pet 3:1, 2Pet 3:2} that the Lord
[some early manuscripts use the word ^Jesus^ or ^Joshua^ or ^God^] saved
people out of ^the^ land of Egypt, ^and thereafter^ [or ^in the second place^]
He destroyed those ^who did^ not believe. {Ex 12:51; Deut 1:32; Deut 2:15;
Ps 106:26; 1Cor 10:5, Heb 3:16, Heb 3:17} |6| Angels and those who did not
keep their first place, but deserted their dwelling place, He has kept in
eternal chains under blackness for a great day of judgement. {2Pet 2:4,
2Pet 2:9} |7| Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, in a similar
manner to these, committed fornication and went away after other [or ^strange^
or ^different^] flesh, {Gen 19:24-38, Deut 29:23, 2Pet 2:2} [full phrase is
^and went away after other flesh laid before times^] an example of undergoing
^the^ everlasting fire ^of^ vengeance. {Matt 25:41, 2Thes 1:8-12, 2Pet 2:6,
2Pet 3:7}

|8| Likewise indeed also these dreamers defile even flesh, despise ^authority^
[or ^lordship^], and speak evil of glories. [likely angels or celestial beings]
{2Pet 2:10} |9| But the archangel Michael, {Dan 10:13, Dan 10:21, Dan 12:1,
Rev 12:7} when contending with the Devil, ^when arguing^ [or ^he argued^] about
the body of Moses, {Deut 34:6} he dared not bring a judgment of blasphemy, but
said, "Let ^the^ Lord rebuke you." {Zech 3:2, 2Pet 2:11} [alluding to the
Jewish ^Testament of Moses^ written approximately in the first century A.D.]
|10| But these speak evil of what things they ^do^ not know; {2Pet 2:12} and
what things they understand naturally, as animals without reason, [or what
things they understand by instinct] by these they are corrupted. {Phil 3:19}
|11| Woe to them, because they went in the way of Cain {Gen 4:3-Gen 4:8,
Heb 11:4, 1John 3:12} and gave themselves to the error of Balaam ^for^ reward,
{Num 31:16, 2Pet 2:15, Rev 2:14} and in the ^rebellion^ [or ^gainsaying^] of
Korah ^they^ perished! {Num 16:1-3; Num 16:31-35} |12| These are the rocky
reefs in your love feasts, feasting together with you, {2Pet 2:13, 1Cor 11:20-22}
feeding themselves without fear, {Ezek 34:2, Ezek 34:8, Ezek 34:10} waterless
clouds having been carried about by winds, {Prov 25:14; 2 Pet 2:17} autumn
trees without fruit, twice dying having been uprooted, {Matt 15:13} |13| wild
waves of ^the^ sea, {Eph 4:14; Isa 57:20} foaming up shame for themselves,
{Phil 3:19} wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness has been
^reserved^ [or ^kept^] ^forever^ [literally ^to the age^]. {2Pet 2:17, Jude 1:6}
