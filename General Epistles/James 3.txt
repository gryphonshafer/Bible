~ James 3 ~

= Controlling the Tongue =

|1| Not many ^of you should^ become teachers, my brothers, {Matt 23:8, Rom 2:20-
29, 1Tim 1:7} knowing that we will receive greater [or ^stricter^] judgment. |2|
We all stumble ^in^ many for ^ways^. {1 Kings 8:46; Romans 3:9-20; James 2:10; 1
John 1:8} If anyone stumbles not in word, this ^is^ a mature man, {Psalm 39:1;
Proverbs 10:19; 1 Peter 3:10; Matt 12:34-37; Jas 1:26} able also to bridle the
whole body.

# 3-6

# |3| Behold, of the horses the bits in the mouths we put,
# for to obey them us, and whole the body of them we turn about.
# |4| Behold, also the ships so great being,
# and by hard winds being driven,
# is directed by a very little rudder,
# where the impulse of the ^one^ steering purposes.
# |5| So also the tongue a little member is,
# and great things boast.
# Behold, how little a fire how great wood kindles;
# |6| and the tongue ^is^ a fire, the world of iniquity;
# so the tongue is set among the members of us,
# spotting all the body, and inflaming the course of nature,
# and being inflamed by Gehenna.

# 7-12

# |7| Every for nature of beasts both and of birds of reptiles both and of sea animals,
# is tamed and has been tamed by the nature human;
# |8| the but tongue no one is able of men to tame;
# ^it is^ an unrestrainable evil,
# full of poison death-dealing.
# |9| By this we bless God and ^the^ Father,
# and by this we curse men according to ^the^ image of God having come being,
# |10| into out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing,
# not it is fitting, brothers of me, these things so to be.
# |11| ^Does^ the fountain out of the same hole send forth the sweet and the bitter?
# |12| Not is able, brothers of me, a fig-tree olives to produce, or a vine figs?
# So neither a fountain salt and sweet to produce water.
