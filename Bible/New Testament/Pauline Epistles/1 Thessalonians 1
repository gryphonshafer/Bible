|2| We give thanks to God always [or ^without ceasing^] {Eph 5:20; 2Th 1:3}
concerning you all, {Ro 1:8} making mention of you ^in^ [literally ^on^] our
prayers, {Ro 1:9; Ro 1:10; 2Tm 1:3} |3| unceasingly remembering your work of
faith, {Jhn 6:29; Ja 2:14-26} and the labor of love, {Ga 5:6; 2Th 1:11} and the
patience [or ^perseverance^ or ^steadfastness^] of hope {Ro 8:25; Ro 15:4; 1Co
13:13} ^in^ [literally ^of^] our Lord, Jesus Christ, before [or ^in the sight

|4| knowing, brothers [the plural of the Greek word ^adelphoi^ here translated

^who are^ [literally ^having been^] loved by God, {2Th 2:13} your election {Ro
1:7; 2Pt 1:10} |5| because our gospel {2Co 2:12; 2Th 2:14} ^did^ not came to
you in word only, but also in power, {Ro 15:19; 1Co 2:4; 1Th 2:10} and in ^the^
Holy Spirit, and ^with^ [literlaly ^in^] much assurance, as you know what sort
we were among you because of you. {Lk 1:1} |6| And you became imitators of us
and of the Lord, {2Tm 4:2} welcoming the word in affliction with much joy of
^the^ Holy Spirit, {Ac 13:52; 1Co 4:16; 1Co 11:1; Ga 5:22} |7| so ^that^ you
become patterns {1Tm 4:12} to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia. {Ac
16:9; Ac 18:12; Ro 15:26} |8| For the word of the Lord sounded from you, not
only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has
gone ^forth^, [literally ^out^] {Ro 1:8; Ro 10:18; Ro 16:19; 2Co 2:14; 2Th 3:1}
so ^there is^ no need for us to have to ^say^ [literally ^speak^] anything. |9|
For ^they^ themselves announce about us what kind of ^reception^ [literally
^entrance^] we have ^with^ you, and how you had turned to God from the idols,
{1Co 12:2; Ga 4:8} to serve ^the^ living and true God, {Mt 16:16; Jhn 17:3; Ac
14:15} |10| and to await the His Son from the heavens, {1Co 1:7} whom He raised
from ^the^ dead, Jesus. {Ac 1:11; Ac 2:24} He delivers us from the coming
wrath. {Mt 3:7; Ro 1:18; Ro 5:9; Co 1:13; 1Th 2:16; 1Th 5:9}
