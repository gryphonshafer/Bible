= Greeting =

|1| Paul, a prisoner {Phlm 1:9, Phlm 1:23, Eph 3:1} of Christ Jesus, and Timothy {Acts 16:1} our brother, {2 Cor 1:1; Gal 3:26; Col 1:1} to Philemon the beloved and our fellow worker, |2| and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus {Col 4:17} our fellow soldier, {Phil 2:25; 2 Tim 2:3} and to the church in your house: [likely meaning ^to the church that meets in your house^] {Rom 16:5}

|3| Grace and peace to you ^all^ [plural form of the Greek word for ^you^; also in verses 22 and 25; whereas elsewhere in this letter the word ^you^ is singular] from God our father and ^the^ Lord Jesus Christ.

= Philemon's Love and Faith =

|4| I thank my God, {Rom 1:8} always making mention of you ^in^ my prayers, {Rom 1:10} |5| hearing of your love and faith which you have ^in^ the Lord Jesus, {Acts 20:21} and to all the saints, [or ^holy ones^] {Eph 1:15, Col 1:4, 1 Thess 3:6} |6| so ^that^ [or ^as^] the fellowship of your faith may be ^effective^ [or ^operative^] in a full knowledge of every good thing {Phil 1:9, Col 1:9, Col 3:10} in you for Christ Jesus. |7| For we have much joy and encouragement {2 Cor 7:4, 2 Cor 7:13} ^because of^ [or ^over^] your love, ^such^ that the ^hearts^ [literally ^bowels^] of the saints [or ^holy ones^] have been refreshed {Phlm 1:20, Rom 15:32, 1 Cor 16:18} through you, brother.

= Paul’s Plea for Onesimus =

|8| Therefore, ^although I^ have enough [literally ^much^] boldness in Christ {2Cor 3:12, 1Thess 2:6} to ^command^ [literally ^enjoin^] you ^to do^ the fitting thing, |9| I ^would^ rather beseech ^you out of^ [or ^because of^] love; ^since I am^ such a ^person^ [literally ^a one being as^] as Paul, an ^old man^, [literally the ^aged one^; some translate it to ^an ambassador^] and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. {1Tim 1:12, Phlm 1:23} |10| I beseech you concerning my child, {1Thess 2:11} whom I fathered [Paul led Onesimus to Christ; {1Co 4:15}] ^while I was in bondage^, {Acts 21:33} [literally ^in the bonds of me^] Onesimus, [the name ^Onesimus^ means ^useful^] {Col 4:9} |11| then useless to you, but now useful to you and to me, |12| whom I sent back to you. Receive even him, this is of my ^heart^, [literally ^bowels^; alternatively ^receive him as a part of myself^] |13| whom I resolved with myself to hold, that for you he ^would^ minister to me in the bonds of the gospel. {Phil 1:7} |14| But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, ^so^ that you ^would^ be good not by necessity, but by willingness. {2Cor 9:7, 1Pet 5:2; 1Cor 4:14-21} [literally ^by way of necessity^ and ^by way of willingness^] |15| Perhaps for this ^reason^ he was separated ^from you^ for an hour, that you might ^have him back^ eternally, |16| no longer as a slave, but beyond a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, how much more to you both in ^the^ flesh and in ^the^ Lord.

|17| If then you have me ^as^ a partner, {2Cor 8:23} receive him as me. |18| And if he wronged you ^in^ anything, or owes ^you^, ^charge^ that to me: [literally ^this to me reckon^] {Gen 43:9} |19| I Paul have written ^this^ with my ^own^ hand, {1Cor 16:21} I will repay; that I ^may^ not say to you that also indeed you owe yourself to me. |20| Yes, brother, may I have help from you in ^the^ Lord; refresh my ^heart^ [or ^bowels^] in ^the^ Lord. {Phlm 1:7, 1Cor 16:18} |21| Having trusted your obedience, I wrote to you, know that you ^will do^ even beyond what I say |22| And also: Prepare lodging for me. I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you. {2Cor 1:11, Phil 1:19; Phil 2:24, Heb 13:19}

= Final Greetings =

|23| My fellow captive in Christ Jesus, {Rom 16:7, Col 4:10} Epaphras, {Col 1:7, Col 4:12} greets you, |24| ^as do^ my fellow workers Mark, {Acts 12:12, Acts 12:25, Acts 15:37-Acts 15:39, Col 4:10} Aristarchus, {Acts 19:29, Acts 27:2, Col 4:10} Demas, {Col 4:14, 2Tim 4:10-2Tim 4:22} ^and^ Luke.

|25| The grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, ^be^ with your spirit. Amen. [an early manuscript includes the word ^amen^] {Gal 6:18, 2Tim 4:22}
