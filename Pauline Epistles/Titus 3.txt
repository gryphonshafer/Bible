~ Titus 3 ~

= Living in Holiness =

|1| Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, {Ro 13:1; 1Pt 2:13;
1Pt 2:14} to be obedient, to be ready for [literally ^in^] every good work,
{2Tm 2:21; Ti 2:14} |2| to speak evil of no one, {Eph 4:31} to be
uncontentious, forbearing, [not litigious or full of chiding; but temperate and
patient] {1Tm 3:3; Ja 3:13; 1Pt 2:18} showing forth all meekness to all men.
{2Tm 2:25}

|3| For we also once were, senseless, disobedient, ^and^ led astray, {2Tm 3:13}
slaving for various lusts and pleasures, {Ro 6:6; Ro 6:12} living in malice [or
^evil^] and envy; {Ro 1:29} hateful, ^and^ hating one another. {Ro 11:30; Co
3:7} |4| But when the kindness {Ro 2:4; Eph 2:7; 1Pt 2:3} and love of God our
Savior toward man appeared, {Ti 2:11} |5| He saved us; {2Tm 1:9} not by works
in righteousness which we had done, {Eph 2:9} but according to His mercy, {Eph
2:4; 1Pt 1:3} through ^the^ washing {Jhn 3:5; Ac 22:16; Eph 5:26; 1Pt 3:21} of
regeneration and renewal {Ro 12:2} of ^the^ Holy Spirit |6| which He poured out
on us richly {Ro 5:5} through Jesus Christ our Savior, |7| that being justified
by that grace, {Ro 3:24} we might become heirs {Mt 25:34; Mk 10:17; Ro 8:17; Ro
8:24; Ti 1:2} of [or ^according to^] ^the^ hope {Ro 8:24} of life eternal. [or
^of eternal life according to hope^] {Mt 25:46; Ti 1:2}

|8| This word is faithful; {1Tm 1:15} and as to these things, I desire you to
affirm ^them^ strongly ^so^ that ^those^ having believed God may take thought
to maintain good works. {Ti 2:7; Ti 2:14; Ti 3:14} These things are good and
profitable to men.

|9| Keep them back from foolish controversies [or ^questionings^] and
genealogies and arguments and quarrels of law; {1Tm 1:4; 2Tm 2:14-16; 2Tm 2:23;
Ja 4:1} for they are unprofitable and vain. [or ^useless^ or ^worthless^] |10|
Avoid a heretic [literally ^a heretic man^] {2Jn 1:10} after one and a second
warning, {Ro 16:17; 2Tm 2:14} |11| knowing that such a one has been perverted
^by^ sin [literally ^as sins^] , being self-condemned.

= Final Instructions and Greetings =

|12| When I send Artemas or Tychicus {Ac 20:4; 2Tm 4:12} to you, hasten to come
to me at Nicopolis; {2Tm 4:9} for I have decided to winter there. {2Tm 4:21}
|13| Immediately send [literally ^urgently set forward^] Zenas the lawyer and
Apollos {Ac 18:24} and ^ensure^ they lack nothing. |14| And also let our
^people^ learn to maintain good works for necessary purposes [or ^uses^] , {Ro
12:13; Php 4:16; Ti 3:8} ^so^ that they ^will^ not be without fruit. {Mt 7:19;
Php 1:11; Co 1:10}

|15| All those with me greet you. Greet those ^who^ love us in ^the^ faith.

Grace ^be^ with you all. {Co 4:18; 1Tm 1:2} Amen.
