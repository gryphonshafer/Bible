~ Titus 3 ~

= Living in Holiness =

|1| Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, {Rom 13:1, 1 Pet 2:13, 1 Pet 2:14} to be obedient, to be ready for [literally ^in^] every good work, {2 Tim 2:21, Titus 2:14} |2| to speak evil of no one, {Eph 4:31} to be uncontentious, forbearing, [not litigious or full of chiding; but temperate and patient] {1 Tim 3:3, 1 Pet 2:18; Jas 3:13} showing forth all meekness to all men. {2 Tim 2:25}

|3| For we also once were, senseless, disobedient, ^and^ led astray, {2 Tim 3:13} slaving for various lusts and pleasures, {Rom 6:6, Rom 6:12} living in malice [or ^evil^] and envy; {Rom 1:29} hateful, ^and^ hating one another. {Rom 11:30, Col 3:7} |4| But when the kindness {Rom 2:4; Eph 2:7; 1 Pet 2:3} and love of God our Savior toward man appeared, {Titus 2:11} |5| He saved us; {2 Tim 1:9} not by works in righteousness which we had done, {Eph 2:9} but according to His mercy, {Eph 2:4; 1 Pet 1:3} through ^the^ washing {Acts 22:16, John 3:5, Eph 5:26, 1 Pet 3:21} of regeneration and renewal {Rom 12:2} of ^the^ Holy Spirit |6| which He poured out on us richly {Rom 5:5} through Jesus Christ our Savior, |7| that being justified by that grace, {Rom 3:24} we might become heirs {Matt 25:34, Mark 10:17, Rom 8:17, Rom 8:24, Titus 1:2} of [or ^according to^] ^the^ hope {Rom 8:24} of life eternal. [or ^of eternal life according to hope^] {Matt 25:46, Titus 1:2}

|8| This word is faithful; {1 Tim 1:15} and as to these things, I desire you to affirm ^them^ strongly ^so^ that ^those^ having believed God may take thought to maintain good works. {Titus 2:7, Titus 2:14, Titus 3:14} These things are good and profitable to men.

|9| Keep them back from foolish controversies [or ^questionings^] and genealogies and arguments and quarrels of law; {1 Tim 1:4, 2 Tim 2:23, 2 Tim 2:14-16, Jas 4:1} for they are unprofitable and vain. [or ^useless^ or ^worthless^] |10| Avoid a heretic [literally ^a heretic man^] {2 John 1:10} after one and a second warning, {2 Tim 2:14; Rom 16:17} |11| knowing that such a one has been perverted ^by^ sin [literally ^as sins^], being self-condemned.

= Final Instructions and Greetings =

|12| When I send Artemas or Tychicus {Acts 20:4; 2 Tim 4:12} to you, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis; {2 Tim 4:9} for I have decided to winter there. {2 Tim 4:21} |13| Immediately send [literally ^urgently set forward^] Zenas the lawyer and Apollos {Acts 18:24} and ^ensure^ they lack nothing. |14| And also let our ^people^ learn to maintain good works for necessary purposes [or ^uses^], {Titus 3:8, Rom 12:13, Phil 4:16} ^so^ that they ^will^ not be without fruit. {Matt 7:19, Phil 1:11, Col 1:10}

|15| All those with me greet you. Greet those ^who^ love us in ^the^ faith.

Grace ^be^ with you all. {Col 4:18; 1 Tim 1:2} Amen.
