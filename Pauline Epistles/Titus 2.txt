~ Titus 2 ~

= Sound Teaching and Proper Living =

|1| You, however, speak the things which become sound [or ^healthy^] teaching.
{Ti 1:9} |2| Aged men {1Tm 5:1} ^should^ be temperate, sensible, discreet,
^and^ sound in the faith, {Ti 1:13} in love, {1Co 13:1; 1Jn 4:16} ^and^ in
patience. [or ^perseverance, steadfastness, endurance^] {1Tm 3:2}

|3| Aged women likewise ^should be^ reverent in behavior, not slanderers, {1Tm
3:11} not having been enslaved by much wine, {1Tm 3:8} teachers of good, |4|
^so^ that they may train the young women {1Tm 5:2} to be lovers of ^their^
husbands, child-lovers, |5| discreet, chaste, homeworkers, {1Tm 5:14} good,
being subject to ^their^ own husbands, {Eph 5:22} ^so^ that the word of God
^will^ not be blasphemed. {1Tm 6:1}

|6| Likewise, exhort the younger men {1Tm 5:1; 1Pt 5:5} to be discreet. [or
^sensible^] |7| ^In^ all things, present [or ^show^] yourself as [or ^about^] a
pattern of good works; {1Tm 4:12} in teaching, in purity, sensibleness,
incorruption, sound speech, irreprehensible; ^so^ that the of opposition ^will^
be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us. {1Pt 2:12}

|9| Slaves ^are^ to be subject to ^their^ own masters in all things; {Eph 6:5;
1Tm 6:1; 1Pt 2:18} to be well-pleasing, not contradicting, |10| not stealing,
but showing all good faith, ^so^ that the teaching of God our Savior {Lk 1:47}
they may adorn in all things. {Mt 5:16; Php 2:15}

|11| For the grace {Ro 3:24} of God appeared {2Tm 1:10} to save all men, {1Tm
2:4} |12| instructing [or ^disciplining^] us that having denied ungodliness and
worldly lusts, {1Tm 6:9; Ti 3:3} we might live discreetly and righteously and
godly in the present age, {1Tm 6:17} |13| expecting the blessed hope and
appearance {1Co 1:7; 1Tm 6:14} of the glory of the great God our Savior, Jesus
Christ, |14| who gave Himself on our behalf, {Mt 20:28} that He might redeem us
from all iniquity {Ps 130:8; Mt 1:21} and cleanse {Ek 37:23; He 1:3; 1Jn 1:7}
for Himself a special people, {Ex 19:5; De 14:2; Ml 3:17; 1Pt 2:9} zealous of
good works. {Mt 5:16; 2Co 8:21; Eph 2:10; 1Pt 2:12,15; 1Pt 3:13}

|15| These things speak and exhort and convict with all authority. {1Tm 4:13;
1Tm 5:20; 2Tm 4:2} Let no one despise you. {1Tm 4:12}
