~ Titus 2 ~

= Sound Teaching and Proper Living =

|1| You, however, speak the things which become sound [or ^healthy^] teaching. {Titus 1:9} |2| Aged men {1 Tim 5:1} ^should^ be temperate, sensible, discreet, ^and^ sound in the faith, {Titus 1:13} in love, {1 Cor 13:1, 1 John 4:16} ^and^ in patience. [or ^perseverance, steadfastness, endurance^] {1 Tim 3:2}

|3| Aged women likewise ^should be^ reverent in behavior, not slanderers, {1 Tim 3:11} not having been enslaved by much wine, {1 Tim 3:8} teachers of good, |4| ^so^ that they may train the young women {1 Tim 5:2} to be lovers of ^their^ husbands, child-lovers, |5| discreet, chaste, homeworkers, {1 Tim 5:14} good, being subject to ^their^ own husbands, {Eph 5:22} ^so^ that the word of God ^will^ not be blasphemed. {1 Tim 6:1}

|6| Likewise, exhort the younger men {1 Tim 5:1; 1 Pet 5:5} to be discreet. [or ^sensible^] |7| ^In^ all things, present [or ^show^] yourself as [or ^about^] a pattern of good works; {1 Tim 4:12} in teaching, in purity, sensibleness, incorruption, sound speech, irreprehensible; ^so^ that the of opposition ^will^ be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us. {1 Pet 2:12}

|9| Slaves ^are^ to be subject to ^their^ own masters in all things; {Eph 6:5; 1 Tim 6:1; 1 Pet 2:18} to be well-pleasing, not contradicting, |10| not stealing, but showing all good faith, ^so^ that the teaching of God our Savior {Luke 1:47} they may adorn in all things. {Matt 5:16; Phil 2:15}

|11| For the grace {Rom 3:24} of God appeared {2 Tim 1:10} to save all men, {1 Tim 2:4} |12| instructing [or ^disciplining^] us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts, {1 Tim 6:9, Titus 3:3} we might live discreetly and righteously and godly in the present age, {1 Tim 6:17} |13| expecting the blessed hope and appearance {1 Cor 1:7, 1 Tim 6:14} of the glory of the great God our Savior, Jesus Christ, |14| who gave Himself on our behalf, {Matt 20:28} that He might redeem us from all iniquity {Matt 1:21; Ps 130:8} and cleanse {1 John 1:7; Ezek 37:23; Heb 1:3} for Himself a special people {Exod 19:5, Deut 14:2, Mal 3:17, 1Pet 2:9}, zealous of good works. {Matt 5:16; 2 Cor 8:21; Eph 2:10; 1 Pet 2:12,15; 1 Pet 3:13}

|15| These things speak and exhort and convict with all authority. {1 Tim 4:13, 1 Tim 5:20, 2 Tim 4:2} Let no one despise you. {1 Tim 4:12}
