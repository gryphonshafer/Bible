~ 1 John 2 ~

|1| Little children of me, these I write to you, that not you sin. And if anyone
sins, an advocate we have with the Father, Jesus Christ ^the^ righteous; |2| and He
a propitiation is concerning the sins of us; not concerning ours and only, but
also concerning all the world. |3| And by this we know that we have known him, if
the commands of him we keep. |4| The ^one^ saying, I have known Him, and the
commands of Him not keeping a liar is, and in this one the truth not is, |5| whoever
but keeps of him the word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected.
By this we know that in him we are. |6| The ^one^ saying in him to remain ought as
that ^one^ walked, also himself so to walk. |7| Brothers, not a commandment new I
write to you, but a commandment old, which you had from ^the^ beginning the
commandment old is the word which you have heard from ^the^ beginning. |8| Again
commandment new I write to you, what is true in Him and in you, because the
darkness is passing away, and the light true already shines. |9| He saying in the
light to be and the brother of him hating in the darkness is until now. |10| He
loving the brother of him, in the light rests, and offense in him not is, |11| the
^one^ but hating the brother of him, in the darkness is, and in the darkness
walks, and not knows where he is going; for the darkness blinded. The eyes of
him. |12| I write to you, little children, for have forgiven been you the sins
because of the name of him. |13| I write to you, fathers, because you have known the
^one^ from beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because you have overcome the
evil one. I wrote to you, young ones, for you have known the Father, |14| I wrote to
you, fathers, because you have known the ^one^ from beginning. I wrote to you
young men, that strong you are, and the word of God in you remains, and you have
overcome the evil one. |15| Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If
anyone loves the world, not is the love of the father in him; |16| because all which
^is^ that in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the
pride of life, not is of the father, but of the world is. |17| And the world is
passing away, and the lust of it; he but doing the will of God remains to the
age. |18| Young ones, a last hour it is, and as you heard that the antichrist is
coming, even now antichrists may have come to be; from which you know that a
last hour it is. |19| From us they went out but not they were of us; if for they were
of us, they have remained would with us; but that is might be revealed that not
they are all of us |20| and you an anointing have from the holy one, and you know
all. |21| Not I wrote to you because not you know the truth, but because you know it,
and because every lie of the truth not is. |22| You is the liar, except the ^one^
denying that Jesus now is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the ^one^ denying
the father and the son. |23| Everyone denying the Son neither the father has; the
^one^ confessing the Son also the Father has. |24| You then what you heard from ^the^
beginning, in you let it remain. If in you remains what from beginning you
heard, both you in the Son and in the Father will remain. |25| And this is the
promise which He promised us the life everlasting. |26| These things I wrote to you
concerning those leading astray you. |27| And you the anointing which received from
Him in you remains, and no need you have that anyone teach you; but as the of
him anointing teaches you concerning all things, and true is, and not is a lie,
and as he taught you, remain in him. |28| And now, little children, remain in him,
that when he is revealed we may have confidence, and not be shamed from him in
the coming of him. |29| If you know that righteous he is, know that everyone doing
the righteousness, of him has been born.
