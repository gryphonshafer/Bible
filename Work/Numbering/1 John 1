~ 1 John 1 ~

What was from ^the^ beginning what we have heard, what we have seen with the
eyes of us, what we beheld, and the hands of us touched, concerning the Word of
life, and the Life was revealed, and we have seen, and we bear witness, and we
announce to you the Life everlasting, which was with the Father, and was
revealed to us, what we have seen, and we have heard, we announce to you, that
also you fellowship may have with us, truly fellowship and our ^is^ with the
Father and with the Son of Him, Jesus Christ. And these thing write to you, that
the joy of you be fulfilled. And this is the message which we have heard from
Him, and we announce to you, that God is light is, and darkness in Him not is,
none. If we say that fellowship we have with Him, and in the darkness we walk,
we lie, and not are doing the truth. If but in the light we walk, as He is in
the light, fellowship we have with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ
the Son of Him cleanses us from all sin. If we say that sin not we have
ourselves we deceive, and the truth not is in us. If we confess the sins of us,
faithful He is and righteous, that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse
us from all unrighteousness. If we say that not we have sinned, a liar we make
Him, and the word of Him not is in us.
