~ 1 Thessalonians 2 ~

|1| Yourselves for, you know, brothers the entrance of us to you, that not in vain
it has been, |2| but also having suffered before and having been insulted, as you
know, in Philippi we were bold in the God of us to speak to you the gospel of
God, in much struggle, |3| the for exhortation of us not of error. Nor of
uncleanness. Nor in guile, |4| but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted
^with^ the gospel so we speak, not as men pleasing, but God the ^one^ testing
the hearts of us. |5| Neither for then in word of flattery were we, as you know, not
with pretext of covetousness, God ^is^ witness, |6| nor seeking from men glory,
neither from you, nor from others, being able with heaviness to be, as of Christ
apostles; |7| but we were gentile in ^the^ midst of you, as if a nurse should
cherish the of herself children, |8| so longing for you, we were well-pleased to
impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also the of ourselves souls,
because beloved to us you have become, |9| you remember for, brothers, the labor of
us and the toil, night for and day working in order to not put a burden on
anyone of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. |10| You ^are^ witnesses, and
God, how holily and righteously and blamelessly to you, those believing, we
were, |11| even as you know how one each of you, as a father children of himself, |12| 
exhorting you and consoling, and testifying for to have walked you worthily of
God the ^one^ calling you to the of himself kingdom and glory. |13| Therefore and we
give thanks to God without ceasing, that having received ^the^ word of hearing
from us, of God, you welcomed, not ^as^ a word of men, |14| but as it is truly, a
word of God, which also work in you, those believing. You for imitators became,
brothers, of the churches of God being in Judea in Christ Jesus, because these
things suffered also you by the own fellow-countrymen, as also they by the Jews, |15|
those both the Lord killing, Jesus, and the own prophets, and us driving and God
not pleasing, and to all men contrary, |16| hindering us to the nations to speak,
that they be saved, to fill up of them the sins always has come but on them the
wrath to ^the^ end. |17| We but brothers being taken away from you for time of an
hour, in face, not in heart, more abundantly were eager the face of you to see
with much desire. |18| Therefore we desired to come to you, I indeed Paul, both once
and twice, and hindered us Satan, |19| what for of us hope of joy or crown of
boasting? Not even you before the Lord of us, Jesus Christ at the of him coming? |20| 
You for are the glory of us and the joy.
