~ 1 Thessalonians 1 ~

Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of Thessalonians in God ^the^
Father, and ^the^ Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God ^the^
Father of us and ^the^ Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God always
concerning all you, mention of you making on the prayers of us, unceasingly
remembering of you the work of faith, and the labor of love, and the patience of
hope of the Lord of us, Jesus Christ, before the God and Father of us, knowing,
brothers, having been loved by God the election of you; because the gospel of us
not came to you in word only, but also in power, and in ^the^ Spirit Holy, and
in assurance much, as you know what sort we were among you because of you. And
you imitators of us became and of the Lord, welcoming the word in affliction
much with joy of ^the^ Spirit Holy, so as to become you patterns to all those
believing in Macedonia and Achaia, from you for sounded the word of the Lord not
only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place the faith of you toward
God has gone out, so as not need for us to have to speak anything; themselves
for about us announce what kind of entrance we have to you, and how you had
turned to God from the idols, to serve God living and true, and to await the Son
of Him from the heavens, whom He raised from ^the^ dead, Jesus, He delivering us
from the wrath coming.
