~ 1 Peter 2 ~

|1| Laying aside then all malice and all guilt, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all
evil words, 

|2| as newborn babes, the spiritual pure milk desire, that by it you may
grow, 

|3| if indeed you tasted that good the Lord ^is^, 

|4| to whom drawing near, a
stone living, by men indeed having been rejected by but God elect, precious,

|5| also yourselves as stones living are being built a house spiritual, a priesthood
holy, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.


|6| Because indeed it is contained in the Scripture. Behold, I lay in Zion a stone
corner foundation elect, precious, and the ^one^ believing on him not at all
shall be shamed. 

|7| To you, then, then honor, those believing, to disobeying ones,
but a stone which rejected those building. 

|8| This ^one^ came to be for head of
^the^ corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense to those stumbling
at the word disobeying, to which indeed they were appointed 

|9|you but a race
elect, a royal priesthood, a nation holy, a people for possession, so as the
virtues you may speak out of he from darkness you calling into the marvelous of
him light; 

|10| who then not a people, now but people Godâ€™s, those not pitied, now
but pitied. 

|11| Beloved, I exhort ^you^ as sojourners and aliens to abstain from
fleshly lusts, which war against the soul, 

|12| the behavior of you among the nations
having good, that in which they speak against you as evildoers, by the good
works having witnessed, they may glorify God in a day of visitation. 

|13| Be obedient, then, to every of men ordinance because of the Lord; whether to a king
as being supreme, 

|14| or to governors, as through him having been sent for vengeance
indeed ^on^ evildoers, praise but of well-doers; 

|15| because so is the will of God,
doing good to silence the of foolish men ignorance; 

|16| as free, and not as a cover
having of evil freedom but as slaves of God, 

|17| all honor, the brotherhood love,
God fear, the king honor. 

|18| Servants, be obedient in all fear to the masters ^of
you^, not only to the good and forbearing but also to the perverse. 

|19| This for
^is^ a grace, if because of conscience of God bears anyone grief, suffering
unjustly, what for glory ^is it^ if sinning and being buffeted you patiently
endure? 

|20| But if doing good and suffering you patiently endure, this ^is^ a grace
from God, 

|21| to this for you were called even Christ suffered on behalf of us, for
us leaving behind an example that you should follow the steps of Him; 

|22| who sin
did not do, nor was found guile in the mouth of him; 

|23| who being reviled did not
revile in return; suffering, not he threatened, gave ^himself^ but to him
judging righteously, 

|24| the sins of us who himself carried up in the body of him
onto the tree, that to sins dying, to righteousness we might live; of whom by
the wound of him you were healed, 

|25| you were for as sheep wandering, but you
turned not to the shepherd and overseer of the souls of you.
