# you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my
# feet," have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with
# evil thoughts? Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those
# who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the
# kingdom he promised those who love him? But you have dishonored the poor. Is
# it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are
# dragging you into court?

# who shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped
# the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became
# powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. Women received back their dead,

the earth, not any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and the no, no; ^so^
that you ^will^ not fall under judgement. [or ^condemnation^]

# Matthew 5:34-37
# But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is
# God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for
# it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you
# cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply 'Yes'
# or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.

# righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing--to kill the
# righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far
# be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" The LORD said,

# and look toward the sea," he told his servant. And he went up and looked.
# "There is nothing there," he said. Seven times Elijah said, "Go back." The
# seventh time the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is
# rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your
# chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'" Meanwhile, the sky grew
# black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling and Ahab rode
# off to Jezreel.
