~ James 5 ~

= A Warning to the Rich =

|1| Come now, rich ones, {Luke 6:24; 1 Timothy 6:9} weep, cry aloud {Isaiah 15:3; Ezekiel 30:2; Isaiah 13:6} over the hardships {Romans 3:16} ^that^ come upon
^you^. {James 2:2-6}

|2| Your riches have rotted, {Job 13:28} and your garments have become moth-eaten. {Psalms 39:11; Isaiah 50:9; Matthew 6:19, 20}

|3| Your gold and silver have rusted over, and their poison will be to you a
testimony, and ^it^ will eat your flesh as fire. You heaped [or ^hoarded^]
treasure [or ^wealth^] in ^the^ last days. {Matthew 6:19; Luke 12:21; Romans 2:5}

|4| Behold, the wages of the workmen ^who^ have reaped [or ^mowed^ or
^harvested^] your fields, being kept back ^by^ you, [or ^that you failed to
pay^] {Jeremiah 22:13; Malachi 3:5; Deuteronomy 24:15; Leviticus 19:13} cries out, and the cries of those having reaped [or ^mowed^ or
^harvested^] have entered into the ears of ^the^ Lord of Hosts. {Romans 9:29}

|5| You lived luxuriously on the earth, {Luke 16:19} and lived riotously; {1 Timothy 5:6; 2 Peter 2:13} you nourished [or
^fattened^] your hearts as in a day of slaughter. [or ^feasting^] {Jeremiah 12:3; Ezekiel 16:49; Jeremiah 25:34}

|6| You condemned, you murdered the righteous; {James 4:2} he ^does^ not resist you.

= Patience in Suffering =

|7| Be longsuffering, [or ^patient^] then, brothers, until the coming of the
Lord. {1 Thessalonians 2:19} Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being
longsuffering [or ^patient^] over it until it may receive ^the^ early and
latter rain. {1 Corinthians 1:7; Galatians 6:9; Jeremiah 5:24; Joel 2:23; Deuteronomy 11:14}

|8| You also be longsuffering, [or ^patient^] {Luke 21:19} establish your hearts, {1 Peter 4:7} because
the coming of the Lord has drawn near. {1 Corinthians 1:7; 1 Thessalonians 2:19; 1 Thessalonians 3:13}

|9| ^Do^ not murmur [or ^grumble^, ^groan^, or ^complain^] against one another, {James 4:11}
brothers, ^so^ that you ^will^ not be judged. {James 4:12; Matthew 7:1; 1 Corinthians 4:5} Behold, the Judge stands before
the door. {Matthew 24:33; Mark 13:29; Psalms 94:2; 1 Peter 4:5}

|10| Take ^as^ an example of suffering ill and of longsuffering, [or
^patience^] my brothers, the prophets who spoke in the name of ^the^ Lord. {Acts 7:52; Hebrews 11:32-38; Matthew 23:34; Matthew 5:12}

|11| Behold, we count ^as^ blessed those ^who are^ enduring. [or ^steadfast^,
or ^persevering^] {Matthew 5:10; 1 Peter 3:14} You have heard ^of^ the patience of Job, {Job 2:10; Job 42:10, 12-17; Hebrews 10:36} and you saw the end
[or ^outcome^] of ^the^ Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and pitying. {Numbers 14:18; Psalms 103:8; Exodus 34:6}

|12| But before all things, my bothers, do not swear, neither by heaven, not by
the earth, not any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and the no, no; {Matthew 5:34-37} ^so^
that you ^will^ not fall under judgement. [or ^condemnation^]

= The Prayer of Faith =

|13| ^Are^ any among you suffers ^of^ ill? Let him pray. {Psalms 50:15} Are any cheerful? Let
him sing. {1 Corinthians 14:15; Colossians 3:16}

|14| Are any among you infirmed? [or ^sick^] Let him summon the elders of the
church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of
the Lord. {Mark 6:13; Luke 10:34; Isaiah 1:6; Psalms 23:5}

|15| And the prayer of faith will cure [or ^save^, or ^restore^] those being
sick and will raise him ^to^ the Lord; {2 Corinthians 4:14; James 1:6; John 6:39; 1 Corinthians 1:21} and if he may have done ^any^ sin, it
will be forgiven him. {Mark 2:5; Luke 5:20; Matthew 9:2; Isaiah 33:24}

|16| Confess to one another ^your^ offenses, and pray for one another, {2 Kings 4:33} so
^that^ you may be healed. {1 Kings 13:6; Mark 1:5; Hebrews 12:13; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 Kings 17:22; 2 Kings 20:2-5; Acts 19:18} ^The^ petition [or ^prayer^, or ^supplication^] of a
righteous one being made effective ^has^ much strength. [or ^power^] {Genesis 20:17; Numbers 11:2; 2 Kings 19:15-20; Genesis 18:23-32; John 9:31; Proverbs 15:29}

|17| Elijah was a man of like feeling [or ^similar nature^] to us, and in
prayer he prayed ^for it^ not to rain, and it ^did^ not rain on the earth ^for^
three years and six months. {1 Kings 17:1; 1 Kings 18:1; Luke 4:25; Acts 14:15}

|18| And again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its
fruit. {1 Kings 18:41-45}

|19| Brothers, if anyone among you errs from the truth and turns anyone ^with^
him, {Matthew 18:15; James 3:14; Galatians 6:1}

|20| know that the ^one^ turning a sinner from ^the^ error of his ways {Romans 11:14} will
save ^the^ soul from death and will hide [of ^cover^] a multitude of sins. {Proverbs 10:12; 1 Peter 4:8}
