~ James 4 ~

= Submission to God =

|1| From where ^do^ wars and fights among you ^come^? ^Is it^ not from this,
from your lusts [or ^desires^ or ^pleasures^] warring [or ^battling^] in your
members?

# Titus 3:9
# But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels
# about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.

# Romans 7:23
# but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind
# and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.

# 1 Peter 2:11
# Living Godly Lives in a Pagan Society - Dear friends, I urge you, as
# foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against
# your soul.

|2| You desire and ^do^ not have. You murder and are jealous [or ^covet^] and
are not able to obtain. You fight and you war, [or ^quarrel^] and you do not
have because you ^do^ not ask.

# Matthew 5:21, 22
# Murder - "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall
# not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'

# You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.

# 1 John 3:15
# Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no
# murderer has eternal life residing in him.

|3| You ask, and you ^do^ not receive, because you ask wrongly, [ask with wrong
motives, or ^wicketdly^] ^so^ that on your lusts you may spend.

# Psalms 66:18
# If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;

# Matthew 7:7
# Ask, Seek, Knock - "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find;
# knock and the door will be opened to you.

# 1 John 3:22
# and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do
# what pleases him.

# 1 John 5:14
# This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything
# according to his will, he hears us.

|4| Adulterers and adulteresses, do you not know that friendship ^with^
[literally ^of^] the world is enmity ^with^ [literally ^of^] God? Whoever then
purposes [or ^wishes^] to be a friend of the world is shown to be an enemy of
God.

# Romans 8:7
# The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's
# law, nor can it do so.

# Hosea 9:1
# Punishment for Israel - Do not rejoice, Israel; do not be jubilant like the
# other nations. For you have been unfaithful to your God; you love the wages
# of a prostitute at every threshing floor.

# James 1:27
# Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look
# after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being
# polluted by the world.

# Hosea 2:2-5
# Israel Punished and Restored - "Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is
# not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look
# from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts. Otherwise I
# will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will
# make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with
# thirst. I will not show my love to her children, because they are the
# children of adultery. Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them
# in disgrace. She said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my
# water, my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.'

# Isaiah 54:5
# For your Maker is your husband-- the LORD Almighty is his name-- the Holy One
# of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of all the earth.

# Jeremiah 3:20
# But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been
# unfaithful to me," declares the LORD.

# Hosea 3:1
# Hosea's Reconciliation With His Wife - The LORD said to me, "Go, show your
# love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an
# adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to
# other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes."

# Ezekiel 16:32
# "'You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband!

# Jeremiah 2:2
# "Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: "This is what the LORD says:
# "'I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and
# followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown.

# 1 John 2:15
# On Not Loving the World - Do not love the world or anything in the world. If
# anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them.

# John 15:19

# not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why
# the world hates you.

# Matthew 6:24
# "No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the
# other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot
# serve both God and money.

|5| Or do you think that Scripture says vainly, " ^He^ yearns envyiously ^for^
the spirit which has dwelt in us"?

# Numbers 23:19
# God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should
# change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not
# fulfill?

# 1 Corinthians 6:19
# Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in
# you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;

# 2 Corinthians 6:16
# What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the
# temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk
# among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."

|6| But he gives greater grace. Therefore, it says: "God sets ^himself^ against
the proud, [literally ^proud ones^] but he gives grace to the humble."
[literally ^humble ones^]

# 1 Peter 5:5
# In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All
# of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God
# opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."

# 1 Peter 5:6-9
# Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you
# up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. Be

# lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith,
# because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is
# undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

# Ephesians 6:11
# Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the

ones^]

# Even in laughter the heart may ache, and rejoicing may end in grief.

# Luke 6:25

and we will spend one year there, and we will trade and will make a profit."

# Luke 12:18-20
# "Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build
# bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll say to myself,
# "You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink
# and be merry."' "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life
# will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for
# yourself?'

# Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.

# because of the misery that is coming on you.

|14| ^You^ who ^do^ not know of tomorrow. [or ^what will happen tomorrow^] What
^is^ your life? [or ^what kind of life is yours^; literally ^what for the life
of you^] For it is a mist, which for a little ^while^ appears and then
disappears.

^even we will live^] and we will do this or that."

# But as he left, he promised, "I will come back if it is God's will." Then he
# set sail from Ephesus.

^pretensions^] ; all such boasting is evil.

# 1 Corinthians 5:6

# whole batch of dough?

sin.

# Luke 12:47
# "The servant who knows the master's will and does not get ready or does not
# do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows.

# It would have been better for them not to have known the way of
# righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the
# sacred command that was passed on to them.

# Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that
# you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
