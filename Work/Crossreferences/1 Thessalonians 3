~ 1 Thessalonians 3 ~

|1| So ^when we could^ no longer endure, we were pleased to be left in Athens

alone,

# Acts 17:15
# Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions
# for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.

# Acts 17:15, 16
# Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions
# for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.

# 1 Thessalonians 3:5
# For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about
# your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and
# that our labors might have been in vain.

|2| and sent Timothy our brother and minister of God, and our fellow worker
[some manuscripts read ^servant^] in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and
to encourage you about our faith,

# 2 Corinthians 2:12
# Ministers of the New Covenant - Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel
# of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,

# Philemon 1
# Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our
# dear friend and fellow worker-- also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our
# fellow soldier--and to the church that meets in your home: Grace and peace to
# you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Thanksgiving and Prayer -
# I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, because I hear about
# your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus.

# 1 Corinthians 3:9
# For we are co-workers in God's service; you are God's field, God's building.

# Acts 16:1
# Timothy Joins Paul and Silas - Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a
# disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but
# whose father was a Greek.

# 2 Corinthians 1:1
# Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
# To the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout
# Achaia:

# Colossians 1:1
# Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,

# Hebrews 13:23
# I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives
# soon, I will come with him to see you.

# Philippians 2:19
# Timothy and Epaphroditus - I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you
# soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.

|3| ^so^ no one ^will^ be drawn aside [or ^deceived^ or ^disturbed^] by these
afflictions. For you yourselves know that to this we are appointed,

# Acts 9:16
# I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."

# Acts 14:22
# strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith.
# "We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God," they said.

# 2 Corinthians 1:4
# who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any
# trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.

# Romans 5:3
# Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that
# suffering produces perseverance;

# Mark 4:17
# But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or
# persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.

# 2 Timothy 3:12
# In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be
# persecuted,

# 2 Corinthians 4:17
# For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory
# that far outweighs them all.

|4| for even when we were with you, we said before [or ^beforehand^ or ^in
advance^] to you that we are about to be afflicted, [or ^persecuted^] as also
it happened, [or ^and so it happened^] and you know. [or ^as you know^]

# 1 Thessalonians 2:14
# For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God's churches in Judea,
# which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things
# those churches suffered from the Jews

|5| Therefore ^when^ I ^could^ [literaly ^also^] no longer endure, ^I^ sent to
know ^of^ your faith, lest somehow the tempting ^one^ tempted you, and in vain
became our labor.

# Philippians 2:16
# as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on
# the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.

# 2 Corinthians 6:1
# As God's co-workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.

# Philippians 2:19
# Timothy and Epaphroditus - I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you
# soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.

# Matthew 4:3
# The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these
# stones to become bread."

# 1 Thessalonians 3:2
# We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God's service in
# spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your
# faith,

# 1 Thessalonians 3:1
# So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by
# ourselves in Athens.

# Galatians 2:2
# I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed
# as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles.
# I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in
# vain.

|6| But now ^that^ Timothy ^has^ come to us from you, and annouced to us the
good news of your faith and love, and that you have good rememberance of us
always, longing to see us, even as also we you.

# Acts 18:5
# When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively
# to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.

# 1 Corinthians 11:2
# On Covering the Head in Worship - I praise you for remembering me in
# everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.

# 1 Thessalonians 1:3
# We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor
# prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus
# Christ.

# Philippians 1:8
# God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:17, 18
# Paul's Longing to See the Thessalonians - But, brothers and sisters, when we
# were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time (in person, not in
# thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.

# Acts 16:1
# Timothy Joins Paul and Silas - Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a
# disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but
# whose father was a Greek.

|7| For these reasons we were comforted, brothers, ^because of^ [literally
^over^] you, in all our affliction and distress, through your faith,

# 2 Corinthians 1:4
# who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any
# trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.

|8| because now we live if you stand in ^the^ Lord.

# 1 Corinthians 16:13
# Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.

|9| For what thanks are we able to return to God concerning you, over all the
joy ^with^ which we rejoice ^because of^ [literally ^by^] you before our God,

# 1 Thessalonians 1:2
# Thanksgiving for the Thessalonians' Faith - We always thank God for all of
# you and continually mention you in our prayers.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20
# For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the
# presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?

|10| night and day abundantly petitioning to see your face, and to complete the
things lacking your faith?

# 2 Corinthians 13:9
# We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is that
# you may be fully restored.

# 2 Timothy 1:3
# Thanksgiving - I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear
# conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:17
# Paul's Longing to See the Thessalonians - But, brothers and sisters, when we
# were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time (in person, not in
# thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.

|11| And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord, Jesus Christ, may He direct
our way to you,

# 1 Thessalonians 3:13
# May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the
# presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy
# ones.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:16
# Final Greetings - Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all
# times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.

# Philippians 4:20
# To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:23
# May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your
# whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus
# Christ.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:16
# For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with
# the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in
# Christ will rise first.

# Revelation 21:3
# And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Look! God's dwelling place
# is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his
# people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.

# Galatians 1:4
# who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age,
# according to the will of our God and Father,

# 2 Thessalonians 2:16
# May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his
# grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,

# 2 Thessalonians 3:5
# May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance.

|12| and the Lord make you to abound ^in^ and to exceed in love toward one
another and toward all, even as we also ^are^ toward you,

# 1 Thessalonians 4:1, 10
# Living to Please God - As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we
# instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living.
# Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:9, 10
# Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you
# yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.

# 2 Thessalonians 1:3
# Thanksgiving and Prayer - We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and
# sisters, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the
# love all of you have for one another is increasing.

# Philippians 1:9
# And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge
# and depth of insight,

|13| to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father,
in the presence of our Lord, Jesus Christ, with all His saints.

# 2 Thessalonians 1:7
# and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen
# when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful
# angels.

# Matthew 25:31
# The Sheep and the Goats - "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all
# the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.

# 1 Corinthians 1:8
# He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the
# day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

# 2 Peter 3:14
# So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every
# effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:23
# May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your
# whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus
# Christ.

# Zechariah 14:5
# You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will
# flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.
# Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.

# James 5:8
# You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near.

# 1 Timothy 6:14
# to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord
# Jesus Christ,

# Philippians 2:15
# so that you may become blameless and pure, "children of God without fault in
# a warped and crooked generation." Then you will shine among them like stars
# in the sky

# 1 Thessalonians 3:11
# Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to
# come to you.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:19
# For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the
# presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?

# who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age,
# according to the will of our God and Father,

# Luke 1:6

# commands and decrees blamelessly.

# Jude 14
# Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: "See, the Lord is coming
# with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones

# generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his
# Father's glory with the holy angels."

# Psalms 15:2
# The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the
# truth from their heart;

# 1 Thessalonians 3:2
# We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God's service in
# spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your
# faith,

# Philippians 4:20
# To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:17
# After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together
# with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with
# the Lord forever.
