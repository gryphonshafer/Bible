~ 1 Thessalonians 3 ~

= Concerning Their Faith =

|1| So ^when we could^ no longer endure, we were pleased to be left in Athens
alone, {Acts 17:15; 1 Thessalonians 3:5}
|2| and sent Timothy our brother and minister of God, {1 Corinthians 3:9; Acts 16:1; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Colossians 1:1; Hebrews 13:23; Philippians 2:19} and our fellow worker
[some manuscripts read ^servant^] in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and
to encourage you about our faith, {2 Corinthians 2:12; Philemon 1}
|3| ^so^ no one ^will^ be drawn aside [or ^deceived^ or ^disturbed^] by these
afflictions. {Acts 9:16; Acts 14:22; 2 Corinthians 1:4; Romans 5:3; Mark 4:17; 2 Timothy 3:12; 2 Corinthians 4:17} For you yourselves know that to this we are appointed,
|4| for even when we were with you, we said before [or ^beforehand^ or ^in
advance^] to you that we are about to be afflicted, [or ^persecuted^] {1 Thessalonians 2:14} as also
it happened, [or ^and so it happened^] and you know. [or ^as you know^]
|5| Therefore ^when^ I ^could^ [literaly ^also^] no longer endure, ^I^ sent to
know ^of^ your faith, {Philippians 2:19; 1 Thessalonians 3:1-2} lest somehow the tempting ^one^ tempted you, {Matthew 4:3} and in vain
became our labor. {Philippians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 6:1; Galatians 2:2}

= Timothy's Encouraging Report =

|6| But now ^that^ Timothy ^has^ come to us from you, {Acts 16:1} and annouced to us the
good news of your faith and love, {1 Corinthians 11:2; 1 Thessalonians 1:3; Philippians 1:8} and that you have good rememberance of us
always, longing to see us, even as also we you. {1 Thessalonians 2:17, 18}
|7| For these reasons we were comforted, {2 Corinthians 1:4} brothers, ^because of^ [literally
^over^] you, in all our affliction and distress, through your faith,
|8| because now we live if you stand in ^the^ Lord. {1 Corinthians 16:13}
|9| For what thanks are we able to return to God concerning you, {1 Thessalonians 1:2} over all the
joy ^with^ which we rejoice ^because of^ [literally ^by^] you before our God, {1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20}
|10| night and day abundantly petitioning to see your face, and to complete the
things lacking your faith? {2 Corinthians 13:9; 2 Timothy 1:3; 1 Thessalonians 2:17}

= Prayer for the Church =

|11| And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord, Jesus Christ, may He direct
our way to you, {1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Thessalonians 3:16; Philippians 4:20; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Revelation 21:3; Galatians 1:4; 2 Thessalonians 2:16; 2 Thessalonians 3:5}
|12| and the Lord make you to abound ^in^ and to exceed in love toward one
another and toward all, {1 Thessalonians 4:1-10; 2 Thessalonians 1:3; Philippians 1:9} even as we also ^are^ toward you,
|13| to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, {2 Peter 3:14; Philippians 2:15; Luke 1:6; Psalms 15:2; 1 Thessalonians 3:2}
in the presence of our Lord, Jesus Christ, with all His saints. {2 Thessalonians 1:7; Matthew 25:31; 1 Corinthians 1:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Zechariah 14:5; James 5:8; 1 Timothy 6:14; Jude 14; Mark 8:38; 1 Thessalonians 4:17}
