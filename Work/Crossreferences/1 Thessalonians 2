= Paul's Ministry in Thessalonia =

|1| For you yourselves know, brothers, [the plural of the Greek word ^adelphoi^
here translated as ^brothers^ refers to siblings in a family; depending on
context, ^adelphoi^ may refer either to men or to both men and women who are
siblings; word also appears in 1:4, 2:9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12,
14, 25, 27] that our ^visit^ [literally ^entrance^] to you, has not been in
vain. {2 Thessalonians 1:10; 1 Thessalonians 1:5, 9; 1 Thessalonians 1:9}
|2| But also having suffered before and having been insulted, as you know, in
Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God, ^amid^
[literally ^in^] much struggle. [or ^conflict^ or ^opposition^] {Acts 4:13; Acts 14:5, 19; Acts 16:12, 19-24; Acts 17:1-9; Philippians 1:30}
|3| For our exhortation [or ^appeal^] {Acts 13:15} ^was^ not ^in^ [literally ^of^] error.
Nor of uncleanness. {1 Thessalonians 4:7} Nor in guile. [or ^deceit^] {2 Thessalonians 2:11; 2 Corinthians 4:2; 2 Corinthians 2:17}
|4| But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted ^with^ the gospel, {Galatians 2:7; 1 Timothy 1:11} so
we speak, not to please men, but God, {Galatians 1:10; Romans 2:29; 2 Corinthians 2:17} the ^one who^ tests [or ^approves^ or
^examines^] our hearts. {Romans 8:27}
|5| For neither then did we ^use^ flattering words, [or ^speech^] as you know,
nor with covetousness pretext; {2 Peter 2:3} God ^is^ witness. {1 Thessalonians 2:10}
|6| Nor ^did we^ seek glory from men, {John 5:41} neither from you, nor from others, being
able ^to assert our authority^ [or ^to be burdensome^; literally ^being able to
be with heaviness^] as apostles of Christ. {2 Corinthians 11:7-11; 2 Corinthians 4:5}
|7| But we were gentile [some manuscripts read ^like young children^] in your
midsts, as when a nurse should cherish her ^own^ children. [some manuscripts
use the word ^infants^] {2 Timothy 2:24; 1 Thessalonians 2:11}

|8| ^Having such^ longing for you, [or ^being so fond of you^] we were well-
pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our ^own^ souls,
[or ^lives^] because you have become beloved to us. {2 Corinthians 12:15; 1 John 3:16}
|9| For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil, working night and day, in
order to not put a burden on anyone of you, ^while^ we proclaimed to you the
gospel of God. {Romans 1:1; Philippians 4:16; 2 Corinthians 11:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8; Acts 18:3}
|10| You ^are^ witnesses, and ^so is^ God, ^to^ how holily and righteously and
blamelessly we were to you, those believing, {1 Thessalonians 1:5; 2 Corinthians 1:12; Romans 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 2:5}
|11| even as you know how each one of you, as a father his own children, {1 Thessalonians 4:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:7; 1 Corinthians 4:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:14; 1 John 2:1}
|12| exhorting you and consoling and testifying for you to walk worthily of
God, {Ephesians 4:1; Ephesians 4:17; 2 Corinthians 4:6} ^who^ calls you {1 Thessalonians 5:24; Romans 8:28} to his kingdom and glory. {1 Peter 5:10; 2 Thessalonians 2:14}

|13| And we therefore give thanks to God without ceasing, [or ^constantly^] {1 Thessalonians 1:2}
that having received ^the^ word of God from hearing us, you welcomed ^it^, {Romans 1:8; Galatians 4:14} not
^as^ a word of men, [the Greek word ^anthropoi^ translated here as ^men^ can
refer to both men and women] but as it truly is, a word of God, {Matthew 10:20} which also
works in you, those believing. {Romans 10:17; Hebrews 4:12; Hebrews 4:2}
|14| For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God being in Judea
in Christ Jesus, {1 Thessalonians 1:6; 1 Corinthians 10:32; 2 Thessalonians 1:4-5; Galatians 1:22} because you ^have^ also suffered these things by ^your^ own
fellow countrymen, as also they ^did^ by the Jews, [Greek word ^Ioudaioi^
translated here ^Jews^ can refer to Jewish religious leaders and others under
their influence who opposed the Christian faith]
|15| those ^who^ both killed the Lord Jesus {Acts 2:23; Luke 24:20} and ^their^ own prophets and ^have^
driven us ^out^ [or ^persecuted us^] {Acts 7:52; Matthew 5:12} and ^are^ not pleasing God and ^are^
contrary to all men,
|16| hindering us to speak to the nations, {Acts 22:21, 22} that they be saved, to fill up their
sins always, but the wrath has come on them to ^the^ end. [or ^completely^,
^forever^, or ^altogether^] {1 Corinthians 10:33; 1 Thessalonians 1:10; Daniel 8:23; Genesis 15:16}

= Paul Desires to See the Thessalonians =

|17| But we brothers, being taken away from you for an hour of time, [or ^a
short time^] in face, [or ^in person^] not in heart, [or ^in spirit^] were more
abundantly eager with much desire to see your face. {1 Corinthians 5:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:10; Colossians 2:5}
|18| Therefore we desired to come to you, indeed I Paul, both once and twice,
[or ^again and again^ or ^more than once^] and Satan hindered us, {Matthew 4:10; Romans 1:13; Romans 15:22}
|19| For what ^is^ our hope of joy or crown of boasting? {2 Corinthians 1:14; Isaiah 62:3} ^Are^ not even you
before our Lord, Jesus Christ at his coming? [or ^presence^] {1 Corinthians 15:23; Matthew 24:3; Revelation 1:7; 2 Peter 1:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; Matthew 16:27; 1 John 2:28; Mark 8:38; Philippians 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:15}
|20| For you are our glory and joy. {2 Corinthians 1:14}
