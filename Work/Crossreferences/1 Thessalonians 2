~ 1 Thessalonians 2 ~

|1| For you yourselves know, brothers, [the plural of the Greek word ^adelphoi^
here translated as ^brothers^ refers to siblings in a family; depending on
context, ^adelphoi^ may refer either to men or to both men and women who are
siblings; word also appears in 1:4, 2:9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12,
14, 25, 27] that our ^visit^ [literally ^entrance^] to you, has not been in
vain.

# 2 Thessalonians 1:10
# on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at
# among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed
# our testimony to you.

# 1 Thessalonians 1:5, 9
# because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power,
# with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for
# your sake.

# 1 Thessalonians 1:9
# for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how
# you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,

|2| But also having suffered before and having been insulted, as you know, in
Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God, ^amid^
[literally ^in^] much struggle. [or ^conflict^ or ^opposition^]

# Acts 4:13
# When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were
# unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these
# men had been with Jesus.

# Acts 14:19
# Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They
# stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.

# Acts 16:22
# The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates
# ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.

# Acts 14:5
# There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their
# leaders, to mistreat them and stone them.

# Acts 16:19-24
# When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they
# seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the
# authorities. They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men
# are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar by advocating customs
# unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice." The crowd joined in the attack
# against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and
# beaten with rods. After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into
# prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.

# Acts 17:2-9
# As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he
# reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and proving that the
# Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. "This Jesus I am proclaiming to
# you is the Messiah," he said. Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul
# and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few
# prominent women. But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad
# characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city.
# They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring
# them out to the crowd. But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason
# and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: "These men who
# have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,

# Romans 1:1
# Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for
# the gospel of God--

# Acts 17:1-9
# In Thessalonica - When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis
# and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
# As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he
# reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and proving that the
# Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. "This Jesus I am proclaiming to
# you is the Messiah," he said. Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul
# and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few
# prominent women. But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad

# They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring
# them out to the crowd.

# Acts 16:22-24
# The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates
# ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. After they had been
# severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded
# to guard them carefully. When he received these orders, he put them in the
# inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.

# Acts 16:12
# From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of
# that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.

# Philippians 1:30
# since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear
# that I still have.

|3| For our exhortation [or ^appeal^] ^was^ not ^in^ [literally ^of^] error.
Nor of uncleanness. Nor in guile. [or ^deceit^]

# Acts 13:15
# After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue
# sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for
# the people, please speak."

# 2 Thessalonians 2:11
# For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe
# the lie

# 2 Corinthians 4:2
# Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception,
# nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the
# truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of
# God.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:7
# For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.

# 2 Corinthians 2:17
# Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary,
# in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.

|4| But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted ^with^ the gospel, so
we speak, not to please men, but God, the ^one who^ tests [or ^approves^ or
^examines^] our hearts.

# Galatians 1:10
# Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I
# trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not
# be a servant of Christ.

# Romans 8:27
# And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the
# Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God.

# Galatians 2:7
# On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of
# preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the
# circumcised.

# Romans 2:29
# No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision
# of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person's praise
# is not from other people, but from God.

# Revelation 2:23
# I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he
# who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your
# deeds.

# 2 Corinthians 2:17
# Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary,
# in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.

# 1 Timothy 1:11
# that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he
# entrusted to me.

|5| For neither then did we ^use^ flattering words, [or ^speech^] as you know,
nor with covetousness pretext; God ^is^ witness.

# 2 Peter 2:3
# In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their
# condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not
# been sleeping.

# Romans 1:9
# God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my
# witness how constantly I remember you

# Acts 20:33
# I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:10
# You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we
# were among you who believed.

|6| Nor ^did we^ seek glory from men, neither from you, nor from others, being
able ^to assert our authority^ [or ^to be burdensome^; literally ^being able to
be with heaviness^] as apostles of Christ.

# John 5:41
# "I do not accept glory from human beings,

# 2 Corinthians 11:7-11
# Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the
# gospel of God to you free of charge? I robbed other churches by receiving
# support from them so as to serve you. And when I was with you and needed
# something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from
# Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to
# you in any way, and will continue to do so. As surely as the truth of Christ
# is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.
# Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!

# 2 Corinthians 4:5
# For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves
# as your servants for Jesus' sake.

# John 5:41, 44
# "I do not accept glory from human beings,

# 1 Corinthians 9:1, 2
# Paul's Rights as an Apostle - Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not
# seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?

# 1 Corinthians 9:1
# Paul's Rights as an Apostle - Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not
# seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?

|7| But we were gentile [some manuscripts read ^like young children^] in your
midsts, as when a nurse should cherish her ^own^ children. [some manuscripts
use the word ^infants^]

# 2 Timothy 2:24
# And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone,
# able to teach, not resentful.

# Galatians 4:19
# My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ
# is formed in you,

# 1 Thessalonians 2:11
# For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own
# children,

|8| ^Having such^ longing for you, [or ^being so fond of you^] we were well-
pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our ^own^ souls,
[or ^lives^] because you have become beloved to us.

# 2 Corinthians 12:15
# So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as
# well. If I love you more, will you love me less?

# 1 John 3:16
# This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And
# we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.

# Romans 1:1
# Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for
# the gospel of God--

|9| For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil, working night and day, in
order to not put a burden on anyone of you, ^while^ we proclaimed to you the
gospel of God.

# Romans 1:1
# Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for
# the gospel of God--

# Philippians 4:16
# for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I
# was in need.

# 2 Corinthians 11:9
# And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone,
# for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept
# myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:8
# nor did we eat anyone's food without paying for it. On the contrary, we
# worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden
# to any of you.

# Acts 18:3
# and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.

|10| You ^are^ witnesses, and ^so is^ God, ^to^ how holily and righteously and
blamelessly we were to you, those believing,

# 1 Thessalonians 1:5
# because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power,
# with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for
# your sake.

# 2 Corinthians 1:12
# Paul's Change of Plans - Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that
# we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations
# with you, with integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on
# worldly wisdom but on God's grace.

# Romans 1:9
# God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my
# witness how constantly I remember you

# 1 Thessalonians 2:5
# You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up
# greed--God is our witness.

|11| even as you know how each one of you, as a father his own children,

# 1 Thessalonians 4:6
# and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or
# sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you
# and warned you before.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:7
# Instead, we were like young children among you. Just as a nursing mother
# cares for her children,

# 1 Corinthians 4:14
# Paul's Appeal and Warning - I am writing this not to shame you but to warn
# you as my dear children.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:14
# And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and
# disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with
# everyone.

# Luke 16:28
# for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come
# to this place of torment.'

# 1 John 2:1
# My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if
# anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father--Jesus Christ, the
# Righteous One.

|12| exhorting you and consoling and testifying for you to walk worthily of
God, ^who^ calls you to his kingdom and glory.

# Ephesians 4:1
# Unity and Maturity in the Body of Christ - As a prisoner for the Lord, then,
# I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.

# 1 Peter 5:10
# And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ,
# after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you
# strong, firm and steadfast.

# Ephesians 4:17
# Instructions for Christian Living - So I tell you this, and insist on it in
# the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of
# their thinking.

# 2 Thessalonians 2:14
# He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory
# of our Lord Jesus Christ.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:24
# The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.

# 2 Corinthians 4:6
# For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," made his light shine in
# our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory displayed in
# the face of Christ.

# Romans 8:28
# And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him,
# who have been called according to his purpose.

|13| And we therefore give thanks to God without ceasing, [or ^constantly^]
that having received ^the^ word of God from hearing us, you welcomed ^it^, not
^as^ a word of men, [the Greek word ^anthropoi^ translated here as ^men^ can
refer to both men and women] but as it truly is, a word of God, which also
works in you, those believing.

# Romans 1:8
# Paul's Longing to Visit Rome - First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for
# all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.

# Galatians 4:14
# and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with
# contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as
# if I were Christ Jesus himself.

# 1 Thessalonians 1:2
# Thanksgiving for the Thessalonians' Faith - We always thank God for all of
# you and continually mention you in our prayers.

# Romans 10:17
# Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard
# through the word about Christ.

# Hebrews 4:12
# For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword,
# it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges
# the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

# Matthew 10:20
# for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking
# through you.

# Hebrews 4:2
# For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but
# the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share
# the faith of those who obeyed.

|14| For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God being in Judea
in Christ Jesus, because you ^have^ also suffered these things by ^your^ own
fellow countrymen, as also they ^did^ by the Jews, [Greek word ^Ioudaioi^
translated here ^Jews^ can refer to Jewish religious leaders and others under
their influence who opposed the Christian faith]

# 1 Thessalonians 1:6
# You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in
# the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.

# 1 Corinthians 10:32
# Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God--

# 2 Thessalonians 1:4
# Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in
# all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.

# Galatians 1:22
# I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.

# Acts 17:5
# But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the
# marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to
# Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the
# crowd.

# 2 Thessalonians 1:4, 5
# Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in
# all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.

# 1 Corinthians 7:17
# Concerning Change of Status - Nevertheless, each person should live as a
# believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has
# called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.

|15| those ^who^ both killed the Lord Jesus and ^their^ own prophets and ^have^
driven us ^out^ [or ^persecuted us^] and ^are^ not pleasing God and ^are^
contrary to all men,

# Acts 7:52
# Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed
# those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have
# betrayed and murdered him--

# Acts 2:23
# This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge;
# and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the
# cross.

# Matthew 5:12
# Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same
# way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

# Luke 24:20
# The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death,
# and they crucified him;

|16| hindering us to speak to the nations, that they be saved, to fill up their
sins always, but the wrath has come on them to ^the^ end. [or ^completely^,
^forever^, or ^altogether^]

# 1 Corinthians 10:33
# even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own
# good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.

# Acts 22:21, 22
# "Then the Lord said to me, 'Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.' "

# Acts 17:5
# But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the
# marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to
# Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the
# crowd.

# Acts 18:12
# While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united
# attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment.

# 1 Thessalonians 1:10
# and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who
# rescues us from the coming wrath.

# Daniel 8:23
# "In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely
# wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.

# Genesis 15:16
# In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of
# the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."

# Matthew 23:32
# Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!

# Acts 13:45, 50
# When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to
# contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.

# Acts 14:2, 19
# But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and
# poisoned their minds against the brothers.

# Acts 17:5, 13
# But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the
# marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to
# Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the
# crowd.

|17| But we brothers, being taken away from you for an hour of time, [or ^a
short time^] in face, [or ^in person^] not in heart, [or ^in spirit^] were more
abundantly eager with much desire to see your face.

# 1 Corinthians 5:3
# For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in
# spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed
# judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this.

# 1 Thessalonians 3:10
# Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply
# what is lacking in your faith.

# Colossians 2:5
# For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and
# delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.

|18| Therefore we desired to come to you, indeed I Paul, both once and twice,
[or ^again and again^ or ^more than once^] and Satan hindered us,

# Matthew 4:10
# Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord
# your God, and serve him only.'"

# Romans 1:13
# I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many
# times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in
# order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the
# other Gentiles.

# Romans 15:22
# This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.

# Philippians 4:16
# for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I
# was in need.

|19| For what ^is^ our hope of joy or crown of boasting? ^Are^ not even you
before our Lord, Jesus Christ at his coming? [or ^presence^]

# 1 Corinthians 15:23
# But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who
# belong to him.

# Matthew 24:3
# As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him
# privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the
# sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"

# 2 Corinthians 1:14
# as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you
# can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.

# 2 Thessalonians 2:1, 8
# The Man of Lawlessness - Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and
# our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters,

# Revelation 1:7
# "Look, he is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see him, even those
# who pierced him"; and all peoples on earth "will mourn because of him." So
# shall it be! Amen.

# 2 Peter 1:16
# For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the
# coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his
# majesty.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:23
# May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your
# whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus
# Christ.

# Isaiah 62:3
# You will be a crown of splendor in the LORD's hand, a royal diadem in the
# hand of your God.

# James 5:7, 8
# Patience in Suffering - Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the
# Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable
# crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains.

# 2 Peter 3:4, 12
# They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our ancestors
# died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation."

# John 21:22
# Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that
# to you? You must follow me."

# 1 Thessalonians 3:13
# May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the
# presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy
# ones.

# Matthew 16:27
# For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels,
# and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.

# 1 John 2:28
# God's Children and Sin - And now, dear children, continue in him, so that
# when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.

# Mark 8:38
# If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful
# generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his
# Father's glory with the holy angels."

# Philippians 4:1
# Closing Appeal for Steadfastness and Unity - Therefore, my brothers and
# sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the
# Lord in this way, dear friends!

# 1 Thessalonians 4:15
# According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who
# are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who
# have fallen asleep.

|20| For you are our glory and joy.

# 2 Corinthians 1:14
# as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you
# can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
