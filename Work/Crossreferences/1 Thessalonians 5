~ 1 Thessalonians 5 ~

|1| And concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you ^do^ not have need to
be written,

# 1 Thessalonians 4:9
# Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you
# yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.

# Daniel 2:21
# He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives
# wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.

# Acts 1:7
# He said to them: "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has
# set by his own authority.

|2| for you yourselves accurately know that ^the^ day of ^the^ Lord comes as a
thief at night.

# Matthew 24:43
# But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of
# night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let
# his house be broken into.

# 1 Corinthians 1:8
# He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the
# day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:4

# surprise you like a thief.

# repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not
# know at what time I will come to you.

# 2 Peter 3:10
# But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear

# and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a
# trap.

# Luke 12:39
# But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the
# thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.

|3| For when they say, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction comes on
them, as travail ^does^ to the pregnant woman, and they may not at all escape.

# the dead, for evil finds lodging among them.

# aflame.

# people and Jerusalem by saying, 'You will have peace,' when the sword is at
# our throats!"

# Psalms 35:8
# may ruin overtake them by surprise-- may the net they hid entangle them, may
# they fall into the pit, to their ruin.

# Isaiah 47:9, 11
# Both of these will overtake you in a moment, on a single day: loss of
# children and widowhood. They will come upon you in full measure, in spite of
# your many sorceries and all your potent spells.

# Isaiah 29:5
# But your many enemies will become like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like
# blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant,

# John 16:21
# A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when
# her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is
# born into the world.

# Jeremiah 6:14
# They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. 'Peace,
# peace,' they say, when there is no peace.

# presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might

# Job 15:21
# Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.

# Jeremiah 8:11
# They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. "Peace,
# peace," they say, when there is no peace.

# Ezekiel 13:10
# "'Because they lead my people astray, saying, "Peace," when there is no
# peace, and because, when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with
# whitewash,

|4| But you, brothers, not are in darkness, ^so^ that ^this^ day should
overtake [or ^surprise^] you as a thief;

# Luke 21:34
# "Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness
# and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a
# trap.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:2

# night.

# Acts 26:18
# to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power
# of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place

# 1 John 2:8
# Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you,
# because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.

# 2 Peter 3:10

# Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and
# repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not
# know at what time I will come to you.

# Revelation 16:15
# "Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains
# clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed."

|5| You all are sons of light, and sons of day. We are not of night, nor of
darkness.

# Acts 26:18
# to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power
# of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place
# among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'

# 1 John 2:8
# Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you,
# because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.

# Luke 16:8
# "The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly.
# For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind
# than are the people of the light.

|6| Therefore, let us not also sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be
sober,

# 1 Thessalonians 5:10
# He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together
# with him.

# Ephesians 2:3
# All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our
# flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by
# nature deserving of wrath.

# Romans 13:11
# The Day Is Near - And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has
# already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is
# nearer now than when we first believed.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:13
# Believers Who Have Died - Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be
# uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the
# rest of mankind, who have no hope.

# Acts 24:25
# As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come,
# Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find
# it convenient, I will send for you."

# Matthew 25:13
# "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

# 1 Peter 1:13
# Be Holy - Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope
# on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his
# coming.

# Matthew 24:42
# "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will
# come.

# Romans 13:11-13
# The Day Is Near - And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has
# already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is
# nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is
# almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor
# of light. Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and
# drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and
# jealousy.

|7| for those ^who^ sleep, sleep by night, and those ^who are^ [literally
^being^] drunk, are drunk by night.

# 2 Peter 2:13
# They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of
# pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes,
# reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.

# Acts 2:15
# These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning!

# Romans 13:13
# Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness,
# not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.

|8| But we, being of ^the^ day, let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of
faith and of love, and a helmet of ^the^ hope of salvation;

# Ephesians 6:23
# Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith from God the Father
# and the Lord Jesus Christ.

# Ephesians 6:14, 17
# Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the
# breastplate of righteousness in place,

# Ephesians 6:17
# Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word
# of God.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:5
# You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong
# to the night or to the darkness.

# Isaiah 59:17
# He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on
# his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as
# in a cloak.

# Ephesians 6:14
# Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the
# breastplate of righteousness in place,

# Romans 8:24
# For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who
# hopes for what they already have?

# 1 Peter 1:13
# Be Holy - Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope
# on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his
# coming.

|9| not because God appointed us to wrath, but for ^the^ obtainment of
salvation through ^our^ Lord, Jesus Christ,

# 1 Thessalonians 1:10
# and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who
# rescues us from the coming wrath.

# 2 Thessalonians 2:13, 14
# Stand Firm - But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters
# loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through
# the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.

|10| the ^one who^ died on ^our^ behalf, ^so^ that whether we watch or we
sleep, together with him we may live.

# Romans 14:9
# For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be
# the Lord of both the dead and the living.

# 2 Corinthians 5:15
# And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves
# but for him who died for them and was raised again.

|11| So comfort one another, and build up ^each other^, [literally ^one the
other^] as indeed you do.

# Ephesians 4:29
# Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is
# helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit
# those who listen.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:18
# Therefore encourage one another with these words.

|12| And we ask you, brothers, to ^recognize^ [literally ^know^] those laboring
among you and take leadership of you in ^the^ Lord and warn you, [or ^admonish^
or ^give you instruction^]

# 1 Corinthians 16:18
# For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.

# 1 Corinthians 15:10
# But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without
# effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God
# that was with me.

# 1 Timothy 5:17
# The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double
# honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.

# Hebrews 13:17
# Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they
# keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their
# work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.

# 1 Corinthians 16:16
# to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at
# it.

# Philippians 2:29
# So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,

# Romans 16:6, 12
# Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.

|13| And esteem them most exceedingly in love because of ^their^ work. Be at
peace among yourselves.

# Mark 9:50
# "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty
# again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other."

|14| And we exhort you, brothers, ^to^ warn the insubordinate. Comfort the
faint-hearted, care for those being weak, ^and^ be long-suffering toward all.

# Isaiah 35:4
# say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will
# come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to
# save you."

# 1 Corinthians 8:7-12
# But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so
# accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as
# having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is
# defiled. But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not
# eat, and no better if we do. Be careful, however, that the exercise of your
# rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone with a
# weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol's
# temple, won't that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols?
# So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your
# knowledge.

# 1 Corinthians 13:4
# Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not
# proud.

# Romans 15:1
# We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to
# please ourselves.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:6, 7, 11
# Warning Against Idleness - In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command
# you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and
# disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.

# Romans 14:1
# The Weak and the Strong - Accept the one whose faith is weak, without
# quarreling over disputable matters.

|15| See ^that no one^ [literally ^not anyone^] returns evil for evil, but
always follow the good even toward one another and toward all.

# Matthew 5:44
# But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,

# 1 Thessalonians 5:21
# but test them all; hold on to what is good,

# Romans 12:17
# Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes
# of everyone.

# 1 Peter 3:9
# Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay
# evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a
# blessing.

# Romans 12:9
# Love in Action - Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is
# good.

# Galatians 6:10
# Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially
# to those who belong to the family of believers.

# Ephesians 4:32
# Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in
# Christ God forgave you.

|16| Always rejoice.

# Philippians 4:4
# Final Exhortations - Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again:
# Rejoice!

|17| Pray without ceasing.

# Ephesians 6:18
# And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and
# requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the
# Lord's people.

# Luke 18:1
# The Parable of the Persistent Widow - Then Jesus told his disciples a parable
# to show them that they should always pray and not give up.

|18| In everything give thanks, for this ^is the^ will of God in Christ Jesus
to you.

# Ephesians 5:20
# always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our
# Lord Jesus Christ.

|19| Do not quench the spirit.

# Ephesians 4:30
# And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the
# day of redemption.

|20| ^Do^ not despise prophecies.

# 1 Corinthians 14:31
# For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and
# encouraged.

# 1 Corinthians 14:1-40
# Intelligibility in Worship - Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts
# of the Spirit, especially prophecy. For anyone who speaks in a tongue does
# not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter
# mysteries by the Spirit. But the one who prophesies speaks to people for
# their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. Anyone who speaks in a tongue
# edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. I would
# like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you
# prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in
# tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.

# Acts 13:1
# Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
# Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with
# Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.

# 1 Corinthians 11:4
# Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.

|21| Test all things. Hold fast ^to^ the good.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:15
# Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what
# is good for each other and for everyone else.

# 1 John 4:1
# On Denying the Incarnation - Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but
# test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false
# prophets have gone out into the world.

# 1 Corinthians 14:29
# Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully
# what is said.

# Galatians 6:10
# Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially
# to those who belong to the family of believers.

# Ephesians 5:10
# and find out what pleases the Lord.

# Romans 12:9
# Love in Action - Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is
# good.

|22| Keep back from every form of evil.



|23| And may He, the God of peace Himself, sanctify you fully, and ^your^ whole
spirit and soul and body, ^so you^ may be kept blameless at the coming of ^our^
Lord Jesus Christ .

# 1 Thessalonians 3:13
# May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the
# presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy
# ones.

# 2 Peter 3:14
# So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every
# effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.

# Exodus 31:13
# "Say to the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign
# between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the
# LORD, who makes you holy.

# John 17:17
# Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.

# 1 Thessalonians 3:11
# Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to
# come to you.

# James 1:4
# Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not
# lacking anything.

# Jude 1
# Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have
# been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
# Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. The Sin and Doom of Ungodly
# People - Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the
# salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the
# faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people. For certain
# individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly
# slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our
# God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign
# and Lord. Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the
# Lord at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those
# who did not believe.

# Hebrews 4:12
# For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword,
# it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges
# the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

# Romans 15:33
# The God of peace be with you all. Amen.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:19
# For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the
# presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?

|24| Faithful ^is^ He ^who^ calls you, who also will do ^it^.

# 1 Thessalonians 2:12
# encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls
# you into his kingdom and glory.

# Philippians 1:6
# being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it
# on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

# Numbers 23:19
# God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should
# change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not
# fulfill?

# Romans 8:28
# And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him,
# who have been called according to his purpose.

# 1 Corinthians 1:9
# God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus
# Christ our Lord.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:3
# But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the
# evil one.

|25| Brothers, pray concerning us.

# Hebrews 13:18
# Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live
# honorably in every way.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:1
# Request for Prayer - As for other matters, brothers and sisters, pray for us
# that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it
# was with you.

# Colossians 4:3
# And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we
# may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.

# Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will
# fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,

|26| Greet all the brothes with a holy kiss.

# Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send
# greetings.

# hundred and twenty)

# Colossians 4:16
# After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the
# church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.

|28| The grace of ^our^ Lord Jesus Christ ^be^ with you. Amen.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:18
# The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

# Romans 16:20
# The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord
# Jesus be with you.
