~ 1 Thessalonians 4 ~

= Sanctification and Love =

|1| For the rest, then, brothers, we beseech you and we exhort in ^the^ Lord
Jesus, {2 Thessalonians 3:1, 3, 13; Galatians 6:1} even as you received from us how it behoves you to walk and to please
God, {Colossians 2:6; 2 Corinthians 13:11; 2 Corinthians 5:9; Colossians 1:10; Ephesians 4:1} that you abound more. {Philippians 4:9; 1 Thessalonians 4:10; Philippians 1:9}
|2| For you know what injunctions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.

|3| For this is ^the^ will of God, {Ephesians 5:17} your sanctification, your abstinence from
fornication, {1 Corinthians 1:30; Hebrews 12:14; 1 Corinthians 6:18; Romans 6:19, 22; 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 4:7}
|4| ^that^ each one of you know ^how^ to possess [or ^acquire^] his own vessel
[or ^body^] in purity and honor, {1 Corinthians 7:2, 9; 1 Peter 3:7; Romans 1:24}
|5| not in lustful passion, even as ^do^ also the nations ^who do^ not know
God, {Galatians 4:8; Ephesians 4:17; Romans 1:26}
|6| not to go beyond [or ^overstep^ or ^transgress^] and to overreach [or
^defraud^] his brother in the matter, {1 Thessalonians 2:11; 1 Corinthians 6:8; Hebrews 13:4} because ^the^ avenger the Lord {Psalms 94:1; Deuteronomy 32:35; Romans 12:19; Hebrews 10:30, 31; Leviticus 25:17; Romans 13:4; Romans 2:5-11} ^is^
concerned ^with^ all these, as indeed we told you and solemnly witnessed
before.
|7| For God ^did^ not call us to uncleanness, but ^to^ [literally ^in^] purity. {1 Peter 1:15; Leviticus 11:44}
|8| Therefore, those ^who^ despise ^this do not^ despise ^a^ man but God,
[literally ^those despising not man despises but God^] {Luke 10:16} the ^one who^ also gives
His Holy Spirit to you. {Romans 5:5; Ezekiel 36:27; 2 Corinthians 1:22; 1 John 4:13; Galatians 4:6; 1 John 3:24}

= A Brotherly and Orderly Life =

|9| And concerning brotherly love, you have no need ^for us^ to write to you, {2 Corinthians 9:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:1}
for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another, {1 John 2:27; John 6:45; Romans 12:10; Hebrews 13:1; John 13:34}
|10| for indeed you do it toward all the brothers in all Macedonia. {1 Thessalonians 1:7; Acts 16:9} But we
exhort you, brothers, to abound more, {1 Thessalonians 3:12}
|11| and to try earnestly to be quiet, {Proverbs 17:14; Proverbs 20:3} and to ^mind your own affairs^, {2 Thessalonians 3:12; Proverbs 25:8; 1 Peter 4:15}
[literally ^practice the own^] and to work with your own hands, {Acts 18:3; 2 Thessalonians 3:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:10-12; Ephesians 4:28} as you we
enjoined, [or ^charged^ or ^commanded^]
|12| that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, {Mark 4:11; Colossians 4:5} and ^that^ you may have
need of nothing. {Ephesians 4:28}

= The Coming of Christ =

|13| And I do not desire you to be ignorant, {Romans 11:25} brothers, about those sleeping, {Matthew 9:24; Acts 7:60; 1 Thessalonians 5:6}
lest you grieve as ^do^ the rest, [literally ^also as the rest^] not having
hope. {Ephesians 2:3; Romans 1:13; Ephesians 2:12}
|14| For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, {1 Corinthians 15:3, 4} so also God will bring
with him those having slept through Jesus. {Romans 14:9; 2 Corinthians 5:15; 2 Corinthians 4:14; 1 Corinthians 15:18}

|15| For this we say to you by a word of ^the^ Lord, {2 Corinthians 12:1} that we the living ^who^
remain to the coming of the Lord {1 Thessalonians 2:19; 1 Corinthians 1:7} may not at all go before those having slept. {1 Corinthians 15:18, 51-52; 1 Thessalonians 4:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:10}
|16| Because the Lord himself, with a word of command, by a voice of an
archangel, and with a trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in
Christ will rise again firstly. {Revelation 14:13; 1 Thessalonians 1:10; Matthew 24:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:11; Matthew 16:27; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; Joel 2:11; 1 Corinthians 15:52}
|17| Then we the living remaining together with them will be caught up in
clouds to a meeting of the Lord in ^the^ air, so we will be always with ^the^
Lord. {2 Corinthians 12:2; Acts 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:10; Daniel 7:13; Revelation 11:12; Revelation 1:7; 1 Corinthians 15:52}
|18| So then comfort one another with these words. {1 Thessalonians 5:11}
