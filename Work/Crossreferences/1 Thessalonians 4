~ 1 Thessalonians 4 ~

|1| For the rest, then, brothers, we beseech you and we exhort in ^the^ Lord
Jesus, even as you received from us how it behoves you to walk and to please
God, that you abound more.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:1, 13
# Request for Prayer - As for other matters, brothers and sisters, pray for us
# that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it
# was with you.

# Colossians 2:6
# Spiritual Fullness in Christ - So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as
# Lord, continue to live your lives in him,

# 2 Corinthians 13:11
# Final Greetings - Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full
# restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the
# God of love and peace will be with you.

# Philippians 4:9
# Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me--put it
# into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:10
# And in fact, you do love all of God's family throughout Macedonia. Yet we
# urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,

# 2 Thessalonians 2:1
# The Man of Lawlessness - Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and
# our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters,

# 2 Thessalonians 3:1
# Request for Prayer - As for other matters, brothers and sisters, pray for us
# that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it
# was with you.

# 2 Thessalonians 1:3
# Thanksgiving and Prayer - We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and
# sisters, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the
# love all of you have for one another is increasing.

# Philippians 1:9
# And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge
# and depth of insight,

# 2 Corinthians 5:9
# So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or
# away from it.

# Galatians 6:1
# Doing Good to All - Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you
# who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch
# yourselves, or you also may be tempted.

# Colossians 1:10
# so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way:
# bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,

# Ephesians 4:1
# Unity and Maturity in the Body of Christ - As a prisoner for the Lord, then,
# I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.

# 1 Thessalonians 3:12
# May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for
# everyone else, just as ours does for you.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:12
# Final Instructions - Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge
# those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish
# you.

|2| For you know what injunctions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.



|3| For this is ^the^ will of God, your sanctification, your abstinence from
fornication,

# 1 Corinthians 1:30
# It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us
# wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.

# Hebrews 12:14
# Warning and Encouragement - Make every effort to live in peace with everyone
# and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.

# Ephesians 5:17
# Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.

# 1 Corinthians 6:18
# Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the
# body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.

# 1 Timothy 2:15
# But women will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love
# and holiness with propriety.

# Romans 6:19, 22
# I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations.
# Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to
# ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to
# righteousness leading to holiness.

# 1 Peter 1:2
# who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
# through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ
# and sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.

# 2 Thessalonians 2:13
# Stand Firm - But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters
# loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through
# the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.

|4| ^that^ each one of you know ^how^ to possess [or ^acquire^] his own vessel
[or ^body^] in purity and honor,

# 1 Corinthians 7:2, 9
# But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual
# relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband.

# 1 Peter 3:7
# Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and
# treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the
# gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.

# 2 Corinthians 4:7
# But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing
# power is from God and not from us.

# Romans 1:24
# Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual
# impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.

|5| not in lustful passion, even as ^do^ also the nations ^who do^ not know
God,

# Galatians 4:8
# Paul's Concern for the Galatians - Formerly, when you did not know God, you
# were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.

# Ephesians 4:17
# Instructions for Christian Living - So I tell you this, and insist on it in
# the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of
# their thinking.

# Romans 1:26
# Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women
# exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.

|6| not to go beyond [or ^overstep^ or ^transgress^] and to overreach [or
^defraud^] his brother in the matter, because ^the^ avenger the Lord ^is^
concerned ^with^ all these, as indeed we told you and solemnly witnessed
before.

# Hebrews 2:6
# But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is mankind that you
# are mindful of them, a son of man that you care for him?

# Luke 16:28
# for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come
# to this place of torment.'

# 1 Thessalonians 2:11
# For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own
# children,

# 1 Corinthians 6:8
# Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers
# and sisters.

# Psalms 94:1
# The LORD is a God who avenges. O God who avenges, shine forth.

# Deuteronomy 32:35
# It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their
# day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them."

# Hebrews 13:4
# Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God
# will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.

# Romans 12:19
# Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it
# is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the Lord.

# Hebrews 10:30, 31
# For we know him who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," and again,
# "The Lord will judge his people."

# 2 Corinthians 7:11
# See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what
# eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing,
# what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have
# proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.

# Leviticus 25:17
# Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the LORD your
# God.

# Romans 13:4
# For the one in authority is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong,
# be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God's
# servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.

# Romans 2:5-11
# But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing
# up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous
# judgment will be revealed. God "will repay each person according to what they
# have done." To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and
# immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking
# and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.
# There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first
# for the Jew, then for the Gentile;

|7| For God ^did^ not call us to uncleanness, but ^to^ [literally ^in^] purity.

# 1 Peter 1:15
# But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;

# 1 Thessalonians 2:3
# For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are
# we trying to trick you.

# Leviticus 11:44
# I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy.
# Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves along the ground.

|8| Therefore, those ^who^ despise ^this do not^ despise ^a^ man but God,
[literally ^those despising not man despises but God^] the ^one who^ also gives
His Holy Spirit to you.

# Romans 5:5
# And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out
# into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.

# Ezekiel 36:27
# And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be
# careful to keep my laws.

# 2 Corinthians 1:22
# set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a
# deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.

# 1 John 4:13
# This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his
# Spirit.

# Luke 10:16
# "Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but
# whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."

# Galatians 4:6
# Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the
# Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father."

# 1 John 3:24
# The one who keeps God's commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is
# how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.

|9| And concerning brotherly love, you have no need ^for us^ to write to you,
for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,

# 1 John 2:27
# As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do
# not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all
# things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught
# you, remain in him.

# John 6:45
# It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who
# has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.

# Romans 12:10
# Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.

# Hebrews 13:1
# Concluding Exhortations - Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters.

# 2 Corinthians 9:1
# There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord's
# people.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:1
# The Day of the Lord - Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do
# not need to write to you,

# John 13:34
# "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must
# love one another.

|10| for indeed you do it toward all the brothers in all Macedonia. But we
exhort you, brothers, to abound more,

# 1 Thessalonians 3:12
# May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for
# everyone else, just as ours does for you.

# 1 Thessalonians 1:7
# And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.

# Acts 16:9
# During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging
# him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."

|11| and to try earnestly to be quiet, and to ^mind your own affairs^,
[literally ^practice the own^] and to work with your own hands, as you we
enjoined, [or ^charged^ or ^commanded^]

# Acts 18:3
# and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.

# Proverbs 17:14
# Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a
# dispute breaks out.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:12
# Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and
# earn the food they eat.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:11
# We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they
# are busybodies.

# 2 Thessalonians 3:10-12
# For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: "The one who is
# unwilling to work shall not eat." We hear that some among you are idle and
# disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies. Such people we command
# and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat.

# Proverbs 25:8
# do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your
# neighbor puts you to shame?

# Proverbs 20:3
# It is to one's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.

# 1 Peter 4:15
# If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of
# criminal, or even as a meddler.

# Ephesians 4:28
# Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing
# something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share
# with those in need.

|12| that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, and ^that^ you may have
need of nothing.

# Romans 13:13
# Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness,
# not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.

# Mark 4:11
# He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to
# those on the outside everything is said in parables

# Colossians 4:5
# Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every
# opportunity.

# Ephesians 4:28
# Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing
# something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share
# with those in need.

|13| And I do not desire you to be ignorant, brothers, about those sleeping,
lest you grieve as ^do^ the rest, [literally ^also as the rest^] not having
hope.

# Ephesians 2:3
# All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our
# flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by
# nature deserving of wrath.

# Romans 1:13
# I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many
# times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in
# order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the
# other Gentiles.

# Matthew 9:24
# he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him.

# Acts 7:60
# Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin against
# them." When he had said this, he fell asleep.

# Romans 11:25
# All Israel Will Be Saved - I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery,
# brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has
# experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has
# come in,

# 1 Thessalonians 5:6
# So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and
# sober.

# Ephesians 2:12
# remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from
# citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without
# hope and without God in the world.

|14| For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God will bring
with him those having slept through Jesus.

# Romans 14:9
# For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be
# the Lord of both the dead and the living.

# 2 Corinthians 5:15
# And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves
# but for him who died for them and was raised again.

# 2 Corinthians 4:14
# because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will
# also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:13
# Believers Who Have Died - Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be
# uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the
# rest of mankind, who have no hope.

# 1 Corinthians 15:3, 4
# For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ
# died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

# 1 Corinthians 15:18
# Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.

|15| For this we say to you by a word of ^the^ Lord, that we the living ^who^
remain to the coming of the Lord may not at all go before those having slept.

# 1 Corinthians 15:51
# Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be
# changed--

# Galatians 1:12
# I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it
# by revelation from Jesus Christ.

# 1 Corinthians 15:52
# in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet
# will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.

# 2 Corinthians 12:1
# Paul's Vision and His Thorn - I must go on boasting. Although there is
# nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.

# 1 Thessalonians 4:13
# Believers Who Have Died - Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be
# uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the
# rest of mankind, who have no hope.

# 1 Kings 13:17
# I have been told by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink
# water there or return by the way you came.'"

# 1 Thessalonians 2:19
# For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the
# presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?

# 1 Corinthians 15:18
# Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:10
# He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together
# with him.

# 1 Corinthians 1:7
# Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord
# Jesus Christ to be revealed.

|16| Because the Lord himself, with a word of command, by a voice of an
archangel, and with a trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in
Christ will rise again firstly.

# Revelation 14:13
# Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who
# die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from
# their labor, for their deeds will follow them."

# 1 Thessalonians 1:10
# and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who
# rescues us from the coming wrath.

# Matthew 24:31
# And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather
# his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

# 1 Thessalonians 3:11
# Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to
# come to you.

# Matthew 16:27
# For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels,
# and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.

# 2 Thessalonians 1:7
# and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen
# when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful
# angels.

# 2 Thessalonians 2:1
# The Man of Lawlessness - Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and
# our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters,

# Joel 2:11
# The LORD thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and
# mighty is the army that obeys his command. The day of the LORD is great; it
# is dreadful. Who can endure it?

# Jude 9
# But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about
# the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said,
# "The Lord rebuke you!"

# 1 Corinthians 15:52
# in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet
# will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.

# 1 Corinthians 15:23
# But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who
# belong to him.

|17| Then we the living remaining together with them will be caught up in
clouds to a meeting of the Lord in ^the^ air, so we will be always with ^the^
Lord.

# 2 Corinthians 12:2
# I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third
# heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know--God
# knows.

# Acts 1:9
# After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid
# him from their sight.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:10
# He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together
# with him.

# Daniel 7:13
# "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of
# man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and
# was led into his presence.

# John 12:26
# Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My
# Father will honor the one who serves me.

# Revelation 11:12
# Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And
# they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.

# Revelation 1:7
# "Look, he is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see him, even those
# who pierced him"; and all peoples on earth "will mourn because of him." So
# shall it be! Amen.

# 1 Corinthians 15:52
# in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet
# will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.

|18| So then comfort one another with these words.

# 1 Thessalonians 5:11
# Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you
# are doing.
