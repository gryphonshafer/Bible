# James 2:14-26
# Faith and Deeds - What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims
# to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother
# or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them,
# "Go in peace; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical
# needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not
# accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, "You have faith; I have
# deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my
# deeds.

# 1 Corinthians 13:13

# trouble all over the world have now come here, and Jason has welcomed them
# into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is
