~ 1 Thessalonians 4 ~

|1|
For the rest, then, brothers, we beseech you and we exhort in ^the^ Lord
Jesus, even as you received from us how it behoves you to walk and to please
God, that you abound more,

|2|
you know for what injunctions we have you through the Lord Jesus,

|3|
this for is ^the^ will of God, the sanctifications of you, to abstain you
from fornication,

|4|
to know each one of you the of himself vessel to possess in purity and
honor,

|5|
not in passion of lust, even as also the nations not knowing God,

|6|
not to go beyond and to overreach in the matter the brother of him, because
^the^ avenger the Lord ^is^ concerning all these, as indeed we before told you
and solemnly witnessed

|7|
not for called us God to uncleanness, but in purity.

|8|
Therefore those despising not man despises, but God, the ^one^ also giving
the Spirit of him the holy to you,

|9|
concerning and brotherly love, no need you have to write to you, yourselves
for you taught by God are to love one another;

|10|
indeed for you do it toward all the brothers in all Macedonia. We exhort
but you, brothers, to abound more,

|11|
and to try earnestly to be quiet, and to practice the own, and to work
with the own hands of you, as you we enjoined,

|12|
that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, and of nothing need you
may have.

|13|
Not I do desire and you to be ignorant, brothers, about those sleeping,
lest you grieve as also the rest not having hope.

|14|
If for we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God those having
slept through Jesus will bring with him.

|15|
This for to you we say by a word of ^the^ Lord, that we the living
remaining to the coming of the Lord, not at all may go before those having
slept;

|16|
because himself the Lord with a word of command by a voice of an
archangel, and with a trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in
Christ will rise again firstly,

|17|
then we the living remaining together with them will be caught up in
clouds to a meeting of the Lord in ^the^ air, so always with ^the^ Lord we will
be.

|18|
So then comfort one another with words these.
