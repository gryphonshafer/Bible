~ James 4 ~

= Submission to God =

|1| From where wars and fights among you? Not from this, from the lusts of you
warring in the members of you?

|2| You desire, and not have; you murder and are jealous, and not are able to
obtain; you fight and you warn, do not you have and, because not ask you;

|3| you ask, and not you receive, because wrongly you ask, that on the lusts of
you you may spend.

|4| Adulterers and adulteresses, do not you know that the friendship of the
world enmity of God is? Whoever, then, purposes a friend to be of the world, an
enemy of God is shown to be.

|5| Or do you think that vainly the Scripture says: to envy yearns the spirit
which has dwelt in us? Greater

|6| but he gives grace, therefore it says: God proud ones sets ^himself^
against, to humble ones but he gives grace.

|7| Be subject, therefore to God; oppose the devil, and he will flee from you.

|8| Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse ^the^ hands,
sinners, and purity ^your^ hearts, two-souled ones.

|9| Be distressed and mourn and weep, the laughter of you to mourning let it be
turned, and the joy to shame.

|10| Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.

|11| Do not speak against one another, brothers. He speaking against a brother,
and judging the brother of him, speaks against law, and judges law; if and law
you judge, not you are a doer of law, but a judge.

|12| One is the Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; you who are ho
judges the other?

= Boasting About Tomorrow =

|13| Come now those saying, today or tomorrow we will go into this city, and we
will spend there year one, and we will trade and will make a profit;

|14| who not know of the morrow; what for the life of you? A mist for it is,
which for a little ^while^ appears, then and disappears.

|15| Instead of saying you, if the Lord wills, even we will live and we will do
this or that.

|16| Now but you boast in the vauntings of you; all boastings such evil is.

|17| To ^one^ knowing then good to do. And not doing ^it^, sin to him it is.
