~ 2 Thessalonians 2 ~

|1|
We ask and you, brothers, by the presence of the Lord of us, Jesus Christ,
and of us gathering together to Him,

|2|
for not quickly to be shaken you from the mind, nor to be troubled, neither
through a spirit, nor through speech, nor through epistle, as through us, as
that is come the day of the Christ.

|3|
Let not anyone you deceive, by no way, because unless comes the falling
away first, and is revealed the man of sin, the son of perdition,

|4|
he opposing and exalting himself over everything being called God, or
object of worship, so as him in the temple of God as God to sit, showing
himself that he is a God.

|5|
Do not you remember that yet being with you, these things told you?

|6|
And now the thing rest remaining you know, for to be revealed him in the of
him time,

|7|
the for mystery already works of lawlessness, only he restraining now,
until out of ^the^ midst it comes.

|8|
And then will be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord will consume by
the spirit of the mouth of Him, and bring to nothing by the brightness of the
coming of Him;

|9|
of whom is the coming according to the working of Satan in all power and
signs and wonders of a lie,

|10|
and with all deceit of unrighteousness in those being lost; because the
love of the truth not they received for to be saved them.

|11|
And because of this will send them to them God a working of error for to
believe them the lie,

|12|
that may be judged all those not believing the truth, but having had
pleasure in unrighteousness.

|13|
We but ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, having been
loved by ^the^ Lord, because chose you God from ^the^ beginning to salvation in
sanctification of ^the^ Spirit and belief of ^the^ truth,

|14|
to which He called you through the gospel of us, to obtainment of ^the^
glory of the Lord of us, Jesus Christ.

|15|
So then, brothers, stand, and hold the traditions which you were taught
either by word of by an epistle of us.

|16|
Himself and the Lord of us, Jesus Christ, and the God and Father of us,
the ^one^ loving us and giving comfort eternal and a hope good by grace,

|17|
may he comfort of you the hearts and establish you in every word and work
good.
