~ 1 Thessalonians 3 ~

|1| So ^when we could^ no longer endure, we were pleased to be left in Athens
 alone,

|2| and sent Timothy our brother and minister of God, and our fellow worker
[some manuscripts read ^servant^] in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and
to encourage you about our faith,

|3| ^so^ no one ^will^ be drawn aside [or ^deceived^ or ^disturbed^] by these
afflictions. For you yourselves know that to this we are appointed,

|4| for even when we were with you, we said before [or ^beforehand^ or ^in
advance^] to you that we are about to be afflicted, [or ^persecuted^] as also it
happened, [or ^and so it happened^] and you know. [or ^as you know^]

|5| Therefore ^when^ I ^could^ [literaly ^also^] no longer endure, ^I^ sent to
know ^of^ your faith, lest somehow the tempting ^one^ tempted you, and in vain
became our labor.

|6| But now ^that^ Timothy ^has^ come to us from you, and annouced to us the
good news of your faith and love, and that you have good rememberance of us
always, longing to see us, even as also we you.

|7| For these reasons we were comforted, brothers, ^because of^ [literally
^over^] you, in all our affliction and distress, through your faith,

|8| because now we live if you stand in ^the^ Lord.

|9| For what thanks are we able to return to God concerning you, over all the
joy ^with^ which we rejoice ^because of^ [literally ^by^] you before our God,

|10| night and day abundantly petitioning to see your face, and to complete the
things lacking your faith?

|11| And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord, Jesus Christ, may He direct
our way to you,

|12| and the Lord make you to abound ^in^ and to exceed in love toward one
another and toward all, even as we also ^are^ toward you,

|13| to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father,
in the presence of our Lord, Jesus Christ, with all His saints.
