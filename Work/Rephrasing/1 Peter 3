~ 1 Peter 3 ~

|1|
Likewise, wives, submitting yourselves to the own husbands, that even if
any disobey the word, through the of the wives behavior, without a word they
will be won,

|2|
having witnessed the in fear pure behavior of you.

|3|
Of whom let it be no the outward of braiding of hairs, and of putting
around gold ^jewelry^ or of clothing of garments adorning;

|4|
but the hidden of the heart man, in the incorruptible of the meek and quite
spirit which is before God of great value.

|5|
So for then also the holy women hoping on God adorned themselves,
submitting themselves to the own husbands,

|6|
as Sarah obeyed Abraham, lord him calling, of whom you became children,
doing good and fearing no terror.

|7|
Husbands likewise, dwelling together according to knowledge, as with a
weaker vessel the female, bestowing honor, as truly co-heirs of ^the^ grace of
live, unto not cutting off the prayers of you.

|8|
And finally, all of one mind, sympathetic, loving ^the^ brothers,
tenderhearted, friendly,

|9|
not giving back evil against evil, or reviling against reviling, on the
contrary but, blessing, knowing that to this you were called that blessing you
might inherit.

|10|
The ^one^ for desiring life to love, and to see days good let him hold
back the tongue of him from evil, even ^the^ lips of him not to speak guile;

|11|
let him turn away from evil, and let him do good; let him seek peace and
pursue it;

|12|
because the eyes of ^the^ Lord ^are^ on the righteous, and his ears ^open^
to petition of them; ^the^ face but of ^the^ Lord against ^any^ doing evil
things.

|13|
And who ^is^ he harming you, if of the good imitators you become?

|14|
But if truly you suffer because of righteousness, blessed ^are you^. But
the fear of them do not fear, nor be troubled,

|15|
Lord but the God sanctify in the hearts of you ready and always to give an
answer to everyone asking you a word concerning the in you hope; with meekness
and fear,

|16|
conscience having a good, that while they speak against you as evildoers,
they may be shamed, those abusing of you the good in Christ behavior,

|17|
^it is^ better for doing good if wills the will of God, to suffer, than
^for^ doing evil.

|18|
Because even Christ once concerning sins suffered, the just for the
unjust, that us he might bring to God, being put to death truly in ^the^ flesh,
made alive but in the spirit;

|19|
in which also to the in prison spirits going he proclaimed to disobeying
once then,

|20|
when once waited the of God longsuffering in ^the^ days of Noah, having
been prepared an ark, in which a few, this is, eight souls, were saved through
water.

|21|
Which also us figure now saves, baptism, not of ^the^ flesh a putting away
of ^the^ filth, but of a conscience good an answer toward God, through ^the^
resurrection of Jesus Christ,

|22|
who is at ^the^ right of God, having gone into Heaven, being subjected to
him angels and authorities and powers.
