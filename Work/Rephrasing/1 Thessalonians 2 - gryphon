~ 1 Thessalonians 2 ~

|1| For you yourselves know, brothers, [the plural of the Greek word ^adelphoi^
here translated as ^brothers^ refers to siblings in a family; depending on
context, ^adelphoi^ may refer either to men or to both men and women who are
siblings; word also appears in 1:4, 2:9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12,
14, 25, 27] that our ^visit^ [literally ^entrance^] to you, has not been in
vain.

|2| But also having suffered before and having been insulted, as you know, in
Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God, ^amid^
[literally ^in^] much struggle. [or ^conflict^ or ^opposition^]

|3| For our exhortation [or ^appeal^] ^was^ not ^in^ [literally ^of^] error. Nor of
uncleanness. Nor in guile. [or ^deceit^]

|4| But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted ^with^ the gospel, so we
speak, not to please men, but God, the ^one who^ tests [or ^approves^ or
^examines^] our hearts.

|5| For neither then did we ^use^ flattering words, [or ^speech^] as you know,
nor with covetousness pretext; God ^is^ witness.

|6| Nor ^did we^ seek glory from men, neither from you, nor from others, being
able ^to assert our authority^ [or ^to be burdensome^; literally ^being able to
be with heaviness^] as apostles of Christ.

# Work above complete; work below incomplete...

|7|
but we were gentile in ^the^ midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish the
of herself children,

|8|
so longing for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the
gospel of God, but also the of ourselves souls, because beloved to us you have
become,

|9|
you remember for, brothers, the labor of us and the toil, night for and day
working in order to not put a burden on anyone of you, we proclaimed to you the
gospel of God.

|10|
You ^are^ witnesses, and God, how holily and righteously and blamelessly to
you, those believing, we were,

|11|
even as you know how one each of you, as a father children of himself,

|12|
exhorting you and consoling, and testifying for to have walked you worthily
of God the ^one^ calling you to the of himself kingdom and glory.

|13|
Therefore and we give thanks to God without ceasing, that having received
^the^ word of hearing from us, of God, you welcomed, not ^as^ a word of men,

|14|
but as it is truly, a word of God, which also work in you, those believing.
You for imitators became, brothers, of the churches of God being in Judea in
Christ Jesus, because these things suffered also you by the own fellow-
countrymen, as also they by the Jews,

|15|
those both the Lord killing, Jesus, and the own prophets, and us driving
and God not pleasing, and to all men contrary,

|16|
hindering us to the nations to speak, that they be saved, to fill up of
them the sins always has come but on them the wrath to ^the^ end.

|17|
We but brothers being taken away from you for time of an hour, in face, not
in heart, more abundantly were eager the face of you to see with much desire.

|18|
Therefore we desired to come to you, I indeed Paul, both once and twice,
and hindered us Satan,

|19|
what for of us hope of joy or crown of boasting? Not even you before the
Lord of us, Jesus Christ at the of him coming?

|20|
You for are the glory of us and the joy.
