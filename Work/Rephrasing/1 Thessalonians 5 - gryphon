~ 1 Thessalonians 5 ~

|1| And concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you ^do^ not have need to
be written,

|2| for you yourselves accurately know that ^the^ day of ^the^ Lord comes as a
thief at night.

|3| For when they say, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction comes on
them, as travail ^does^ to the pregnant woman, and they may not at all escape.

|4|
But you, brothers, not are in darkness,
^so^ that ^this^ day should overtake [or ^surprise^] you as a thief;

|5|
You all are sons of light, and sons of day. We are not of night, nor of
darkness.

|6|
Therefore, let us not also sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be sober,

# ^^^ - above complete | vvv - below incomplete

|7|
those for sleeping, by night sleep, and those being drunk by night are drunk;

|8|
we but, of day being, let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith
and of love, and a helmet of hope of salvation;

|9|
because not appointed us God to wrath, but for obtainment of salvation
through the Lord of us, Jesus Christ,

|10|
the ^one^ having died on behalf of us, that whether we watch or we sleep,
together with him we may live.

|11|
So comfort one another, and build up one the other, as indeed you do.

|12|
We ask and you, brothers, to know those laboring among you, and take the
lead of you in ^the^ Lord, and warning you,

|13|
and esteem them most exceedingly in love because of the work of them. Be
at peace among yourselves.

|14|
We exhort and you, brothers, warn the insubordinate. Comfort the
faint-hearted, care for those being weak, be long-suffering toward all.

|15|
See ^that^ not anyone evil for evil to anyone returns, but always the good
follow even toward one another and toward all.

|16|
Always rejoice,

|17|
without ceasing pray.

|18|
In everything give thanks, this for ^is^ ^the^ will of God in Christ Jesus
to you.

|19|
The spirit not do quench,

|20|
prophecies not despise.

|21|
All things test, the good hold fast.

|22|
From every form of evil keep back.

|23|
Himself and, the God of peace, may he sanctify you fully, and whole of you
the spirit, and the soul, and the body, blamelessly at the coming of the Lord
of us, Jesus Christ may be kept.

|24|
Faithful ^is^ he calling you, who also will do ^it^.

|25|
Brothers, pray concerning us.

|26|
Greet the brothes all with kiss a holy.

|27|
I charge you by the Lord to be read the epistle to all the holy brothers.

|28|
The grace of the Lord of us, Jesus Christ ^be^ with you. Amen.
