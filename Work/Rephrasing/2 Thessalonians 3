~ 2 Thessalonians 3 ~

|1|
For the rest, pray, brothers, about us, that the word of the Lord may run
and be glorified, as in deed with you,

|2|
and that we be delivered from perverse and evil men; is not for all of the
faith.

|3|
Faithful but is the lord, who will establish you and will guard from the
evil one.

|4|
We are persuaded and in ^the^ Lord as to you, that what things we enjoin
you both you do and will do.

|5|
The and Lord direct of you the hearts into the love of God, and into the
patience of Christ.

|6|
We enjoin and you, brothers, in the name of the Lord of us, Jesus Christ,
to draw back you from every brother insubordinately walking, and not according
to the tradition which you received from us.

|7|
Yourselves for, you know how it is right to imitate us, because not we were
disorderly among you,

|8|
nor ^as^ a gift bread ate from anyone, but by labor and toil night and day
working for not to burden anyone of you; not that not we have authority,

|9|
but that ourselves an example we give to you for to imitate us, even for
when we were with you,

|10|
this we enjoined you: If anyone not desires to work, not let him eat.

|11|
We hear ^of^ for some walking among you disorderly, nothing working, but
working all about,

|12|
and such we enjoin and exhort through the Lord of Us, Jesus Christ, that
with quietness working the of themselves bread they may eat.

|13|
You and, brothers, do not lose heart ^in^ well-doing.

|14|
If and any not obeys the word of us via the epistle, this one mark, and do
not associate with him, that he be shamed;

|15|
and not as an enemy esteem ^him^, but warn as a brother.

|16|
Himself and, the Lord of peace give to you the peace continually in every
way. The Lord ^be^ with you all you.

|17|
The greeting by my hand, of Paul, which is a sign in every epistle; thus I
write.

|18|
The grace of the Lord of us, Jesus Christ ^be^ with all you. Amen.
