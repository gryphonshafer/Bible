~ 1 Peter 1 ~

|1|
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to ^the^ elect sojourners of ^the^
dispersion of Pontus, of Galatia, of Cappadocia, of Asia, and of Bithynia,

|2|
according to foreknowledge God's, the Father, in sanctification of ^the^
Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of ^the^ blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to
you, and peace, be multiplied.

|3|
Blessed ^be^ the God and Father of the Lord of us, Jesus Christ, the ^one^
according to much of Him mercy, having regenerated us to a hope living through
^the^ resurrection of Jesus Christ from ^the^ dead

|4|
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been
kept in Heaven for you

|5|
by ^the^ power of God, being guarded through faith to a salvation ready to
be revealed in time ^the^ last.

|6|
In which you exult, a little yet if needful it is grieving by manifold
trials,

|7|
that the proving of you of the faith, much more precious than gold of
perishing, through fire yet being proved, may be found to praise and honor and
glory at ^the^ revelation of Jesus Christ;

|8|
whom not having seen, you love, in whom yet not seeing, believing, but; you
exult with joy unspeakable and glorified,

|9|
obtaining the end of the faith of you, ^the^ salvation of ^your^ souls.

|10|
About which salvation sought out and searched out prophets the concerning
the for you grace prophesying,

|11|
searching for what or what sort of time made clear the in them Spirit of
Christ, testifying beforehand of ^belonging^ Christ sufferings, and the after
these glories.

|12|
To whom it was revealed that not to themselves, to us but they ministered
the same, which now were announced to you through those having preached to
gospel to you in ^the^ Spirit Holy sent from Heave, into which things long
angels to look into.

|13|
Therefore, girding up the loins of the mind of you, being sober, perfectly
hope on the being brought to you grace at ^the^ revelation of Jesus Christ.

|14|
As children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves to the formerly in the
ignorance of you lusts,

|15|
but according to the calling you Holy One, also yourselves holy in all
conduct become.

|16|
Because it has been written: holy be, because I holy am.

|17|
And if ^as^ Father you call on ^him^ the ^one^ without respect to persons
judging according to the of each one work, in fear the of the sojourning of you
time pass,

|18|
knowing that not with corruptible things, silver or gold, you were
redeemed from the worthless of you living handed down from fathers,

|19|
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted,

|20|
of Christ, having been foreknown before ^the^ foundation of ^the^ world,
revealed but in ^the^ last of the times because of you,

|21|
those through him believing in God, the ^one^ raising him from ^the^ dead,
and glory to him having given, so as the faith of you and hope to be in God.

|22|
The souls of you having purified in the obedience of the truth, through
^the^ Spirit to brotherly love unpretended, from ^the^ pure heart one another
love fervently,

|23|
having been regenerated not by seed corruptible, but incorruptible through
word ^the^ living of God and remaining to the age.

|24|
Because all flesh ^is^ as grass, and all ^the^ glory of man as ^the^
flower of grass; was dried the grass, and the flower of it fell out,

|25|
the but word of ^the^ Lord remains to the age. This and is the word
preached as gospel to you.
