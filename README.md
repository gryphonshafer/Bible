# Bible Translation Project ##

This is a project to translate the mainstream Protestant Christian Bible
directly from multiple ancient Hebrew and Greek sources into English with the
aid of modern technology. The goal of the project is to construct a Bible that
is readable, grammatically correct, as free from interpretation as possible, and
conveys as accurate a modern meaning as possible.

## Open Content ##

This Bible both as it is being translated and when the initial translation work
is complete will be open, offered freely under a creative commons license.
Specifically, the content is released under the
[Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0)
license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/deed.en_US).
As such, anyone may use the content, in whole or in part,
for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided there is attribution
provided and there is no alteration of the content.

## Perpetual Work in Progress ##

This Bible is intended to be a perpetual work in progress. Once the initial
translation work is complete for any given section or chapter, subsequent
improvements in the content can be discussed, debated, and introduced. All
initial translation work and subsequent perpetual work must be conducted under
the operating procedures of this project. All use of the work outside of this
project is governed by the aforementioned licensing agreement.

## Content Locations and Format ##

Content while being worked upon is located under the "Work" directory. Once
initial translation work is complete for a given chapter, that chapter is
published to the "Bible" directory under a testament, section, book
subdirectory structure.

Published content will be written in Open Bible Markup Language (OBML).
The following is a simplified key for content markup:

    ~...~    --> material reference
    =...=    --> header
    {...}    --> cross-references
    [...]    --> footnotes
    *...*    --> red text
    ^...^    --> italic
    4 spaces --> block-quote (line by line)
    6 spaces --> block-quote + indent (line by line)
    |*|      --> notes the beginning of a verse (numbers ignored)
    #        --> line comments

Quotes (single and double) are stored in the file as "normal" quotes (i.e. not
"smart" quotes).
